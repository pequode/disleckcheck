Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor

Notes on this etext of Moby Dick:

This text is a combination of etexts, one from the now-defunct ERIS
project at Virginia Tech and one from Project Gutenberg's archives.
The proofreaders of this version are indebted to The University of
Adelaide Library for preserving the Virginia Tech version.  The
resulting etext was compared with a public domain hard copy version of
the text.

In chapters 24, 89, and 90, we substituted a capital L for the symbol
for the British pound, a unit of currency.





MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE 

by Herman Melville




ETYMOLOGY.

(Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School)

The pale Usher--threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
now.  He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
known nations of the world.  He loved to dust his old grammars; it
somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

"While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out, through
ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh the signification
of the word, you deliver that which is not true." --HACKLUYT

"WHALE. ... Sw. and Dan. HVAL.  This animal is named from roundness
or rolling; for in Dan. HVALT is arched or vaulted." --WEBSTER'S
DICTIONARY

"WHALE. ... It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. WALLEN;
A.S. WALW-IAN, to roll, to wallow." --RICHARDSON'S DICTIONARY

KETOS,               GREEK.
CETUS,               LATIN.
WHOEL,               ANGLO-SAXON.
HVALT,               DANISH.
WAL,                 DUTCH.
HWAL,                SWEDISH.

EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).

It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
sacred or profane.  Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology.  Far from it.  As
touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
affording a glancing bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously
said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
generations, including our own.

So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
unpleasant sadness--Give it up, Sub-Subs!  For by how much the more
pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
ever go thankless!  Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and
the Tuileries for ye!  But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
Here ye strike but splintered hearts together--there, ye shall strike
unsplinterable glasses!

Jonas-in-the-Whale. ...  Some say the whale can't open his mouth, but
that is a fable. ...  They frequently climb up the masts to see
whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat
for his pains. ...  I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that
had above a barrel of herrings in his belly. ...  One of our
harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that
was white all over." --A VOYAGE TO GREENLAND, A.D. 1671 HARRIS COLL.

speak like great wales." --GOLDSMITH TO JOHNSON.

then towing ashore.  They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves
behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us." --COOK'S
VOYAGES.

"The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack.  They stand in so
great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to
mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood,
and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order
to terrify and prevent their too near approach." --UNO VON TROIL'S

BURKE. (SOMEWHERE.)

"A tenth branch of the king's ordinary revenue, said to be grounded
on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from
pirates and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which are whale and
sturgeon.  And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the
coast, are the property of the king." --BLACKSTONE.

"Soon to the sport of death the crews repair:
Rodmond unerring o'er his head suspends
The barbed steel, and every turn attends."
--FALCONER'S SHIPWRECK.

"Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires,
And rockets blew self driven,
To hang their momentary fire
Around the vault of heaven.

"So fire with water to compare,
The ocean serves on high,
Up-spouted by a whale in air,
To express unwieldy joy." --COWPER, ON THE QUEEN'S
VISIT TO LONDON.

"Ten or fifteen gallons of blood are thrown out of the heart at a
stroke, with immense velocity." --JOHN HUNTER'S ACCOUNT OF THE
DISSECTION OF A WHALE.  (A SMALL SIZED ONE.)

"The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the
water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage
through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood
gushing from the whale's heart." --PALEY'S THEOLOGY.

"The whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet." --BARON
CUVIER.

"In 40 degrees south, we saw Spermacetti Whales, but did not take any

--COLNETT'S VOYAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THE SPERMACETI WHALE
FISHERY.

"In the free element beneath me swam,
Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;
Which language cannot paint, and mariner
Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
To insect millions peopling every wave:
Gather'd in shoals immense, like floating islands,
Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
And trackless region, though on every side
Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm'd in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs."
--MONTGOMERY'S WORLD BEFORE THE FLOOD.

"Io!  Paean!  Io! sing.
To the finny people's king.
Not a mightier whale than this
In the vast Atlantic is;
Not a fatter fish than he,
Flounders round the Polar Sea." --CHARLES LAMB'S TRIUMPH OF THE
WHALE.

"In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the
whales spouting and sporting with each other, when one observed:
there--pointing to the sea--is a green pasture where our children's
grand-children will go for bread." --OBED MACY'S HISTORY OF
NANTUCKET.

form of a Gothic Arch, by setting up a whale's jaw bones."

killed by a whale in the Pacific ocean, no less than forty years
ago." --IBID.

threw up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a Christian would wish to
look at.  He's a raal oil-butt, that fellow!" --COOPER'S PILOT.

"The papers were brought in, and we saw in the Berlin Gazette that
whales had been introduced on the stage there." --ECKERMANN'S

stove by a whale." --"NARRATIVE OF THE SHIPWRECK OF THE WHALE SHIP

LARGE SPERM WHALE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN."  BY OWEN CHACE OF NANTUCKET,
FIRST MATE OF SAID VESSEL.  NEW YORK, 1821.

"A mariner sat in the shrouds one night,
The wind was piping free;
Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale,
And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale,
As it floundered in the sea." --ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH.

"The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture
of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six
English miles. ...

"Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which,
cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four
miles." --SCORESBY.

"Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the
infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous
head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he
rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with
vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed. ...  It is a matter
of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so
interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an
animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected,
or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and
many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have
possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of
witnessing their habitudes." --THOMAS BEALE'S HISTORY OF THE SPERM
WHALE, 1839.

"The Cachalot" (Sperm Whale) "is not only better armed than the True
Whale" (Greenland or Right Whale) "in possessing a formidable weapon
at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a
disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once
so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as
the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale
tribe." --FREDERICK DEBELL BENNETT'S WHALING VOYAGE ROUND THE GLOBE,

"Ay ay, sir!  A shoal of Sperm Whales!  There she blows!  There she

CHAPTER 1

Loomings.


Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long
precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of
driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I
find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but
knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with
her surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its
extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of
sight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from
Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
northward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around
the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the
pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
seaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
desks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they
here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but
the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of
yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh
the water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they
stand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes
and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet
here they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the
needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

Once more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down
in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is
magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his
deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,
and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
that region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American
desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied
with a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation
and water are wedded for ever.

But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There
stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his
cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into
distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture
lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs
like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the
shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit
the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm
wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara
but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see
it?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he
sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
Beach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy
soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your
first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical
vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of
sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did
the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely
all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of
that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the
tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this
is the key to it all.

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I
begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of
my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as
a passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,
and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,
passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do
not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a
passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea
as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and
distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I
abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations
of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take
care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,
schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess
there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer
on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though
once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and
peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to
say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the
idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted
river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their
huge bake-houses the pyramids.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,
the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than
all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have
been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys
stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,
from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of
Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even
this wears off in time.

What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a
broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,
weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think
the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I
promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular
instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the
old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch
me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;
that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same
way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and
so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each
other's shoulder-blades, and be content.

Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves
must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between
paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most
uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon
us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity
with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering
that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly
ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how
cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but
not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in
many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect
it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea
as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a
whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who
has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and
influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than
any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,
formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a
long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo
between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the
bill must have run something like this:


"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."


Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and
short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in
farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I
recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under
various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,
besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting
from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.

Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all
my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his
island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,
with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and
sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such
things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented
with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden
seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am
quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would
they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all
the inmates of the place one lodges in.

By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of
them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.



CHAPTER 2

The Carpet-Bag.


I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good
city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a
Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning
that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no
way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop
at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as
well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my
mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because
there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected
with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides
though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the
business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is
now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre
of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was
stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal
whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the
Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit?

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before
me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it
became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep
meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and
dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the
place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only
brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,
said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street
shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may
conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire
the price, and don't be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of "The
Crossed Harpoons"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
Further on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn,"
there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the
packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the
congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic
pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the
flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles
of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and
jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare
in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.
But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from
before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I
went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,
for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either
hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a
tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that
quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to
a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which
stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant
for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was
to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the
flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that
destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The
Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign of "The Trap."
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed
on and opened a second, interior door.

It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred
black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black
Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;
and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the
weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered
I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'

Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
underneath--"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."

Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
thought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I
suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light
looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and
the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have
been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the
swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought
that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea
coffee.

It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side
palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp
bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse
howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,
nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with
his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  "In judging of that
tempestuous wind called Euroclydon," says an old writer--of whose
works I possess the only copy extant--"it maketh a marvellous
difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where
the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from
that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which
the wight Death is the only glazier."  True enough, thought I, as
this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest
well.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the
house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies
though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too
late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the
copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for
his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might
plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and
yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!
says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one
afterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion
glitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental
summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of
making my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them
up to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in
Sumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise
along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit
itself, in order to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before
the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should
be moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives
like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of
orphans.

But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
is plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our
frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.



CHAPTER 3

The Spouter-Inn.


Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very
large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,
that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only
by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an
understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades
and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young
artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to
delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest
contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by
throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at
last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might
not be altogether unwarranted.

But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to
drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you
to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out
what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,
alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a
midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four primal
elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter
scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at
last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
the picture's midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were
plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish? even the great leviathan himself?

In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a
Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering
there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an
exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in
the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.

The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous
cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such
a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were
storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,
fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was
flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards
slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the
tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,
travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the
hump.

Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier
place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old
wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some
old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this
corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a
long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled
with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking
den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.  Be that how it
may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a
coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,
ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws
of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed
they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their
money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.

Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though
true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel
meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads'
goblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS
a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,
which you may gulp down for a shilling.

Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered
about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of
SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be
accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was
full--not a bed unoccupied.  "But avast," he added, tapping his
forehead, "you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket,
have ye?  I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used
to that sort of thing."

I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and
that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up
with the half of any decent man's blanket.

"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?
Supper'll be ready directly."

I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on
the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning
it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at
the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under
full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.

At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,
each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey
jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half
frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not
only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for
supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to
these dumplings in a most direful manner.

"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty."

"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"

"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the
harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he
don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."

"The devil he does," says I.  "Where is that harpooneer?  Is he
here?"

"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.

I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark
complexioned" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it
so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get
into bed before I did.

Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
evening as a looker on.

Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the
landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in
the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.
Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."

A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in
their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen
comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with
icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had
just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they
entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the
whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there
officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained
of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like
potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for
all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,
or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side
of an ice-island.

The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
capering about most obstreperously.

I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the
sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),
I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full
six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a
coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was
deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the
contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some
reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at
once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I
thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions
had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I
saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few
minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it
seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry
of "Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of
the house in pursuit of him.

It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate
myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to
the entrance of the seamen.

No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes
to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange
town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections
indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a
sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors
no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To
be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your
own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in
your own skin.

The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be
of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all
over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought
to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon
me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been
coming?

"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't
sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here."

"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots
and notches.  "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's
plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."
So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief
first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,
the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;
till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.
The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for
heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did
not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a
pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and
throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went
about his business, and left me in a brown study.

I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too
narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me
from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at
all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one
from the window, and both together formed a series of small
whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought
to spend the night.

The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I
steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,
not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad
idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell
but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the
harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me
down!

Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I
began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable
prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait
awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at
him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after
all--there's no telling.

But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and
threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.

"Landlord! said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep
such late hours?"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.

The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  "No," he
answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to
rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he
went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him
so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."

"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
are telling me?" getting into a towering rage.  "Do you pretend to
say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
this town?"

"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't
sell it here, the market's overstocked."

"With what?" shouted I.

"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"

"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better
stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."

"May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I
rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin' his head."

"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at
this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.

"It's broke a'ready," said he.

"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"

"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."

"Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one
another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a
bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I
have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of
connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the
highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and
what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe
to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so
good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I
take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've
no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,
landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."

"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty
long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,
be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just
arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New
Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but
one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's
Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the
streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,
but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four
heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."

This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and
showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling
me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who
stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged
in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?

"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."

"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.  "But come, it's getting
dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;
Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's
plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty
big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and
little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling
about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came
near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come
along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted
a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I
stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed
"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come
to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"

I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I
was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure
enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
harpooneers to sleep abreast.

"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea
chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there,
make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye."  I turned
round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.

Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of
the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then
glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude
shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man
striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,
there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one
corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's
wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a
parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.

But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to
the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare
it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with
little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills
round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of
this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could
it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,
and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being
uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though
this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I
went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never
saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry
that I gave myself a kink in the neck.

I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time
on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then
stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,
and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel
very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the
landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that
night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of
my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into
bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.

Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I
heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light
come into the room from under the door.

Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a
word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical
New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and
without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off
from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at
the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the
room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted
for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This
accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a
sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here
and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's
just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,
got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at
that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At
first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the
truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a
whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by
them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant
voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,
thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in
any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly
complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and
completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it
might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never
heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.
However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun
there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while
all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this
harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty
having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently
pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair
on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he
then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed
it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver
hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no
hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small
scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now
looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger
stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
than ever I bolted a dinner.

Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,
but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make
of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my
comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely
nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as
much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken
into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him
that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a
satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last
showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him
were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was
all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty
Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green
frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite
plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard
of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian
country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps
the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to
mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!

But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or
wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he
fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little
deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a
three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first
I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved
in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,
and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded
that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to
be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing
the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like
a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks
inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and
places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship
biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the
shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty
snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers
(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded
in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a
little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the
little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he
never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by
still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be
praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,
during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very
unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.

All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in
which I had so long been bound.

But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal
one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of
it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth
at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next
moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk
between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not
help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began
feeling me.

Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But
his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill
comprehended my meaning.

"Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I
kill-e."  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about
me in the dark.

"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I.  "Landlord!
Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"

"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled
the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered
the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on
fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the
room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.

"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here
wouldn't harm a hair of your head."

"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that
that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"

"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads
around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look
here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"

"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a
civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a
moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,
thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has
just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.

"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,
or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I
will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed
with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured."

This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to
say--I won't touch a leg of ye."

"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."

I turned in, and never slept better in my life.



CHAPTER 4

The Counterpane.


Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm
thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had
almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of
patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;
and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise
shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically
in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various
times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a
strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as
the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the
quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was
hugging me.

My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was
a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell
me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely
settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper
or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had
seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,
somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed
supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and
packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon
of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I
felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went
to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as
possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the
sheets.

I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must
elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!
the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;
the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in
the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt
worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in
my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw
myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a
good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning
me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the
best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to
my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great
deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest
subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled
nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in
dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped
in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my
frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the
counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,
to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.
For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most
awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that
if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be
broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from
me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and
for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding
attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often
puzzle myself with it.

Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,
to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events
soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only
alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his
arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still
hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.
I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a
snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a
horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the
counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as
if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;
abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a
tomahawk!  "Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"  At
length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant
expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male
in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;
and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a
Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a
pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning
over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious
misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a
creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the
character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to
the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and
sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress
first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,
this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages
have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous
how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to
Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and
consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him
from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my
curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man
like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding.

He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his
boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under
the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I
inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of
propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private
when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature
in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was
just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest
possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an
undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very
probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,
if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of
getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his
hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed
to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made
to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off
of a bitter cold morning.

Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots
on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet
somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as
possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that
time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but
Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his
ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his
waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand
centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he
takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden
stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,
this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I
wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine
steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the
long straight edges are always kept.

The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out
of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and
sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.



CHAPTER 5

Breakfast.


I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted
the grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards
him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter
of my bedfellow.

However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
good thing; the more's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own
proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not
be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be
spent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully
laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you
perhaps think for.

The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in
the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.
They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and
third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea
blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny
company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing
monkey jackets for morning gowns.

You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,
and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three
days landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few
shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In
the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But
who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various
tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one
array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.

"Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
went to breakfast.

They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at
ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:
Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,
in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's
performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best
mode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,
that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.

These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear
some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly
every man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they
looked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom
without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the
high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without
winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of
the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly
at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some
sheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful
bears, these timid warrior whalemen!

But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head
of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I
cannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not
have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with
him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table
with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
beefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by
him, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do
anything coolly is to do it genteelly.

We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he
eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he
withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his
tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking
with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.



CHAPTER 6

The Street.


If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.

In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from
foreign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean
mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street
is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo
Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford
beats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts
you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand
chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry
on their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.

But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,
Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the
whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see
other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There
weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New
Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They
are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled
forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some
things you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that
chap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and
swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.

No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a
downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when
a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a
distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you
should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In
bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;
straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will
burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,
straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.

But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
and bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is
a queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land
would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast
of Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to
frighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the
dearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,
true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave
them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America
will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more
opulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon
this once scraggy scoria of a country?

Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave
houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up
hither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat
like that?

In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they
say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night
recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.

In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long
avenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful
and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent
is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced
bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside
at creation's final day.

And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.
But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their
cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere
match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell
me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell
them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous
Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.



CHAPTER 7

The Chapel.


In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few
are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or
Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that
I did not.

Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
special errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to
driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the
cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and
sailors' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at
times by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed
purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were
insular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and
there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing
several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on
either side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the
following, but I do not pretend to quote:--

BY
HIS WIDOW.

Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
Queequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was
a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This
savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;
because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was
not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of
the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among
the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded
accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present
wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,
that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically
caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the
desolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in
those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in
those immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden
infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and
refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished
without a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of
Elephanta as here.

In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it
is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we
prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle
him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;
why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon
immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,
hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries
ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we
nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the
living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a
knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are
not without their meanings.

But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
had gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But
somehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine
chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of
whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into
Eternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this
matter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow
here on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at
things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun
through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take
my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three
cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they
will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.



CHAPTER 8

The Pulpit.


I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back
upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the
congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the
chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the
whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a
sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had
dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,
Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort
of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for
among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild
gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth
even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his
history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the
utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran
down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed
almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had
absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one
removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,
arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.

Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome
pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself
nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole
contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no
means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the
ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted
the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.

The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were
of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first
glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient
for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,
slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up
the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving
him impregnable in his little Quebec.

I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober
reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something
unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he
signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and
wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is
a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a
perennial well of water within the walls.

But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its
back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship
beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and
snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling
clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed
forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of
radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver
plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  "Ah,
noble ship," the angel seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble
ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the
clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand."

Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in
the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's
fiddle-headed beak.

What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this
earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit
leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is
first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From
thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for
favourable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not
a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.



CHAPTER 9

The Sermon.


Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority
ordered the scattered people to condense.  "Starboard gangway,
there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!
Midships! midships!"

There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,
and every eye on the preacher.

He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his
large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
at the bottom of the sea.

This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and
joy--

"The ribs and terrors in the whale,
Arched over me a dismal gloom,
While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
And lift me deepening down to doom.

"I saw the opening maw of hell,
With endless pains and sorrows there;
Which none but they that feel can tell--
Oh, I was plunging to despair.

"In black distress, I called my God,
When I could scarce believe him mine,
He bowed his ear to my complaints--
No more the whale did me confine.

"With speed he flew to my relief,
As on a radiant dolphin borne;
Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
The face of my Deliverer God.

"My song for ever shall record
That terrible, that joyful hour;
I give the glory to my God,
His all the mercy and the power.


Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
howling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly
turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand
down upon the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last
verse of the first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great
fish to swallow up Jonah.'"

"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is
one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a
pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that
canticle in the fish's belly!  How billow-like and boisterously
grand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the
kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is
about us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?
Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful
men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,
it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,
hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,
repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in
his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what
that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to
do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors
to persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it
is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God
consists.

"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men
will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
Captains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and
seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a
hitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have
been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of
learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as
far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in
those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly
coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more
than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the
Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought
to flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible
and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking
from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar
hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his
look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere
suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a
deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,
valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with
their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the
Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps
on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil
eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of
the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome
but still serious way, one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed
a widow;" or, "Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry
lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or
belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom."  Another runs to
read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which
the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the
apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his
person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their
hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his
boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will
not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.
So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be
the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into
the cabin.

"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless
question mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee
again.  But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;
how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up
to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he
hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  'We
sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still
intently eyeing him.  'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest
man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.  But he
swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  'I'll sail with
ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not
to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere
the craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of
meaning.

"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.
In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,
and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at
all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of
Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the
usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah
is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that
paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,
prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to
find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is
put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah
now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'  'Thou lookest like it,' says
the Captain, 'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the
door, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling
there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something
about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked
within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into
his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on
his forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that
contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah
feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the
whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.

"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
hung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that
contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the
ceiling, and the side, are all awry.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of
my soul are all in crookedness!'

"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of
the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into
him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in
giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;
and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over
him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the
wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in
his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning
down to sleep.

"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;
and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all
careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of
recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he
will not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the
ship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to
lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;
when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank
thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this
raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky
and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or
heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open
mouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken
it, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and
shrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his
feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon
the sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow
leaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,
and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the
mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the
white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the
blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing
high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his
cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The
sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter
to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose
cause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah's; that
discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.
'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What
people?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The
eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they
not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another
answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is
forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.

"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of
Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'  Fear him, O Jonah?
Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now
goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more
and more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet
supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness
of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him
and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this
great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek
by other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale
howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the
other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth
water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a
masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops
seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to
all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then
Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.  But observe his
prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does
not weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful
punishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting
himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will
still look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and
faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
punishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is
shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.
Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin
but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;
but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah."

While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all
his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to
them.

There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.

But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head
lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake
these words:

"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
upon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson
that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still
more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly
would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there
where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads
ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a
pilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or
speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those
unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at
the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to
escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is
everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came
upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of
doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the
seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,
and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world
of woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any
plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the
ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting
prophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the
shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up
towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and
earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of
the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,
like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the
ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that,
shipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was
it!

"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
the living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms
from Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters
when God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please
rather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than
goodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe
to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!
Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching
to others is himself a castaway!"

He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out
with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard
hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of
that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the
main-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,
far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and
commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of
this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to
him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and
destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of
Senators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who
acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a
patriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this
sure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be
his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O
Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I
die.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or
mine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what
is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"

He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face
with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had
departed, and he was left alone in the place.



CHAPTER 10

A Bosom Friend.


Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
time.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on
the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face
that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
himself in his heathenish way.

But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,
going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his
lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every
fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly
around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of
astonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming
to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count
more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties
being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages
was excited.

With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and
hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his
countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means
disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly
tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and
in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of
a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,
there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his
uncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had
never cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,
that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,
this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
phrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it
reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular
busts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
long promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George
Washington cannibalistically developed.

Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to
be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
book.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the
night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had
found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this
indifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at
times you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are
overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a
Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at
all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made
no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the
circle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;
yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of
Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown
among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet
Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to
himself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt
he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to
be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living
or so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives
himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
old woman, he must have "broken his digester."

As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it
then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms
gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began
to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more
my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish
world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very
indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized
hypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights
to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.
And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were
the very magnets that thus drew me.  I'll try a pagan friend, thought
I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew
my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my
best to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these
advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night's
hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
perhaps a little complimented.

We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
be seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And
then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping
it regularly passing between us.

If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's
breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
left us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we
were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.
In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed
far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple
savage those old rules would not apply.

After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of
them towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;
but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets.  I let
them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his
idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and
symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well
knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case
he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.

I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator
in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.
Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is
worship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the
will of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man
to do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow
man.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,
unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
idolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent
little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before
him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and
went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for
confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,
there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old
couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,
then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving
pair.



CHAPTER 11

Nightgown.


We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,
what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we
felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down
the future.

Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We
felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of
doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire
in the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily
warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality
in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing
exists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over
comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to
be comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,
why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most
delightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping
apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the
luxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of
deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like
the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.

We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all
at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,
whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way
of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the
snugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own
identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were
indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more
congenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming
out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and
coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I
experienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the
hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,
seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong
desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that
though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
love once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than
to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be
full of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly
concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.  I was only alive
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a
blanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our
shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till
slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated
by the flame of the new-lit lamp.

Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native
island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and
tell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill
comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when
I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me
to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton
I give.



CHAPTER 12

Biographical.


Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West
and South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.

When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong
desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
two.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;
and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
unconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his
veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal
propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.

A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a
passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement
of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's
influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his
canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship
must pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a
coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove
thickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still
afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in
the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like
a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his
foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.

In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young
savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.
They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But
like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,
Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily
gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at
bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn
among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still
happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they
were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that
even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
so, than all his father's heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag
Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to
Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it's a wicked world
in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.

And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these
Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.
Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.

By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and
having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and
gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered
no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather
Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled
throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he
would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the
nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in
all four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed
iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.

I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.
Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed
him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most
promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at
once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same
vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with
me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly
dip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously
assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was
an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great
usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries
of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant
seamen.

His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg
embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very
soon were sleeping.


CHAPTER 13

Wheelbarrow.


Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a
barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,
however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the
boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had
sprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock
and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me
concerning the very person whom I now companied with.

We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went
down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at
the wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg
so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But
we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and
Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon
barbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him
ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own
harpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I
hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own
harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal
combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,
like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows
armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish
them--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his
own harpoon.

Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story
about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.
The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry
his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about
the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise
way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;
lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the
wharf.  "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than
that, one would think.  Didn't the people laugh?"

Upon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of
Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant
water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a
punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament
on the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand
merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all
accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea
captain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of
Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;
when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo
cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of
honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the
High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.  Grace being
said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though
Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to
our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance
upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,
the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the
island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself
placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking
himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a
mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain
coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I
suppose for a huge finger-glass.  "Now," said Queequeg, "what you
tink now?--Didn't our people laugh?"

At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one
side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered
trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and
mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by
side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at
last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with
blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening
that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long
voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a
third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,
yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.

Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the
little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
snortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that
turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks
of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity
of the sea which will permit no records.

At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
teeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land
tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the
plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering
glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that
two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man
were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there
were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense
greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his
back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.  Dropping his
harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the
air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow
landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his
back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a
puff.

"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
"Capting, Capting, here's the devil."

"Hallo, YOU sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know
you might have killed that chap?"

"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there,"
pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.

"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an
unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;
Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"

"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if
you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."

But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain
to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had
parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from
side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept
overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the
boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and
back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant
seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,
and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed
towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower
jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,
Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of
the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,
and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as
it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way
trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and
while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped
to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing
his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his
brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand
and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had
gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,
Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see
just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes
more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the
other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The
poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;
the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg
like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that
he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.
He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine
off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning
against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to
be saying to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all
meridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians."



CHAPTER 14

Nantucket.


Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after
a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

Nantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner
of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more
lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,
and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more
sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for
blotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to
plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally; that they import Canada
thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a
leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried
about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant
toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer
time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's
walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every
way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be
found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these
extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.

Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an
eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an
infant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their
child borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to
follow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a
perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an
empty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian's skeleton.

What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
take to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and
quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for
mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured
cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,
explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of
circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in
all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the
mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous
and most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed
with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics
are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!

And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing
from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery
world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did
Poland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;
let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing
banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the
Nantucketer's.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own
empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant
ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even
pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the
road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless
deep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;
he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro
ploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE
lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though
it overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as
prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs
them as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the
land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another
world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the
landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep
between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of
land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very
pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.



CHAPTER 15

Chowder.


It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The
landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea
Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one
of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured
us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.
In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than
try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us
about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened
a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard
hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that
done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these
crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially
as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our
first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.
However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and
then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at
last came to something which there was no mistaking.

Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
old doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the
other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a
gallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the
time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague
misgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.
It's ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my
first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's
chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!
Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?

I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an
injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple
woollen shirt.

"Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"

"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right.  There's Mrs. Hussey."

And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
concluded repast, turned round to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"

"What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.

"Clam or Cod?" she repeated.

"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"
says I, "but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"

But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear
nothing but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door
leading to the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.

"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for
us both on one clam?"

However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking
chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet
friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely
bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted
pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and
plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being
sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing
his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being
surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when
leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod
announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to
the kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with great emphasis, and
resumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth
again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
cod-chowder was placed before us.

We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks
I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?
What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  "But
look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?  Where's your
harpoon?"

Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder
for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till
you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The
area before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a
polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his
account books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy
flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till
one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some
fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish
remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's
decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and
demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  "Why
not? said I; "every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why
not?"  "Because it's dangerous," says she.  "Ever since young Stiggs
coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years
and a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my
first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I
allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at
night.  So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had learned his name), "I will
just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the
chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?"

"Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety."



CHAPTER 16

The Ship.


In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and
no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had
been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little
god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly
insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among
the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;
instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of
the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed
befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a
vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light
upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in
that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present
irrespective of Queequeg.

I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising
forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a
rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the
whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the
selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a
little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best
fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my
remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to
acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a
determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly
settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving
Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that
it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,
and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could
find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never
could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,
then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his
sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.
After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt
that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The
Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know
the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt
remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts
Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about
the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,
going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then
decided that this was the very ship for us.

You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the
old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned
claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the
typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was
darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and
Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut
somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and
wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury
Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,
were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild
business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old
Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another
vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal
owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his
chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid
it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or
bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,
his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of
trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the
chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open
bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp
teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old
hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks
of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a
tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the
long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who
steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he
holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but
somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.

Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,
at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort
of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It
seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical
shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of
limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws
of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a
circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each
other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose
hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the
bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view
forward.

And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and
the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden
of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling
all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of
a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructed.

There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance
of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old
seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker
style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the
minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen
from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become
pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.

"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door of
the tent.

"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
him?" he demanded.

"I was thinking of shipping."

"Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in
a stove boat?"

"No, Sir, I never have."

"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?

"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I've been
several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--"

"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see
that leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou
talkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service
indeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in
those marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a
whaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not
been a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst
thou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to
sea?"

I protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
Vineyard.

"But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think
of shipping ye."

"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world."

"Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain
Ahab?"

"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"

"Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."

"I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain
himself."

"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,
young man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod
fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including
crew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if
thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can
put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past
backing out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find
that he has only one leg."

"What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?"

"Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,
chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped
a boat!--ah, ah!"

I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched
at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly
as I could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could
I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,
though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of
the accident."

"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou
dost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure
of that?"

"Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in
the merchant--"

"Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant
service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it.  But let us understand
each other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye
yet feel inclined for it?"

"I do, sir."

"Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
whale's throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!"

"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."

"Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to
find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in
order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.
Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the
weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there."

For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.
But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg
started me on the errand.

Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that
I could see.

"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye
see?"

"Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable horizon
though, and there's a squall coming up, I think."

"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to
go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world
where you stand?"

I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and
the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all
this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed
his willingness to ship me.

"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added--"come
along with ye."  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
cabin.

Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along
with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the
other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by
a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery
wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of
plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest
their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in
approved state stocks bringing in good interest.

Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and
to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure
the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously
modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of
these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and
whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a
vengeance.

So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in
childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of
the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And
when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,
with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the
stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest
waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been
led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all
nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin
voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some
help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty
language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty
pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all
detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness
at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made
so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,
all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do
with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if
indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the
Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired
whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what
are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious
things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been
originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket
Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many
unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not
moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as
altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,
was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain
Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms
against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the
Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet
had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of
leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,
the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a
man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.
This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short
clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied
waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,
and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded
his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the
goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet
receiving of his well-earned income.

Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his
crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the
hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially
for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the
least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but
somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work
out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured
eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till
you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to
work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and
idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact
embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he
carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the
decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always
sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His
broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his
drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he
seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

"Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have
been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?"

As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.

"He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wants to ship."

"Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.

"I dost," said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.

"What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.

"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as
Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I
said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a
chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink
before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think
it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be
willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the
whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the
captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that
these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining
to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware
that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a
ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I
had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the
275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that
might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they
call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had
a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear
out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which
I would not have to pay one stiver.

It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of
those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite
content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am
putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I
thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not
have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was
of a broad-shouldered make.

But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had
heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony
Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,
therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,
left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty
deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on
board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his
Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying
to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small
surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these
proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself
out of his book, "LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where moth--"

"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay
shall we give this young man?"

"Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust
do corrupt, but LAY--'"

LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for
one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do
corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though
from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a
landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven
hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you
come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven
hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less
than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought
at the time.

"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to
swindle this young man! he must have more than that."

"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without
lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure
is, there will your heart be also."

"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do
ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say."

Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider
the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and
orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the
labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those
widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,
Captain Peleg."

"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
cabin.  "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in
these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that
would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed
round Cape Horn."

"Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art
still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee
foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg."

"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,
ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature
that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again
to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a
live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye
canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!"

As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded
him.

Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,
who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the
awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again
on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest
intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg
and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,
there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,
though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  "Whew!"
he whistled at last--"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.
Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,
will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank
ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye
say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth
lay."

"Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship
too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?"

"To be sure," said Peleg.  "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."

"What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book
in which he had again been burying himself.

"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg.  "Has he ever
whaled it any?" turning to me.

"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."

"Well, bring him along then."

And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that
I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the
identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round
the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,
and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself
visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are
so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,
that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of
that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,
but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it
is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing
yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,
inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.

"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;
thou art shipped."

"Yes, but I should like to see him."

"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know
exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't
sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't
always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,
Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him
well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,
Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you
may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;
Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to
deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,
stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest
that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he
ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,
was a crowned king!"

"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
they not lick his blood?"

"Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance
in his eye that almost startled me.  "Look ye, lad; never say that on
board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name
himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed
mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old
squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove
prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the
same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;
I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good
man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good
man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,
aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the
passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was
the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost
his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of
moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass
off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,
it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he
happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not
three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that
sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any
utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if
he be, Ahab has his humanities!"

As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the
time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know
what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a
strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all
describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt
it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt
impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he
was known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in
other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.



CHAPTER 17

The Ramadan.


As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue
all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for
I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious
obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my
heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a
toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,
who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,
bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on
account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his
name.

I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to
be content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would
not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us
all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow
dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.

Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
"Queequeg," said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  "I say,
Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael."  But all remained
still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such
abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I
looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner
of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister
one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line
of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting
against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the
landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting
to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since
the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without
it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.

"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still.  Something must have happened.
Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly
resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the
first person I met--the chamber-maid.  "La! la!" she cried, "I
thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after
breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and
it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had
both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,
ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these
cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.

Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the
occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black
boy meantime.

"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and
fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a
stroke; depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the
mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her
countenance.

"What's the matter with you, young man?"

"Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I
pry it open!"

"Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the
vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; "look here; are you
talking about prying open any of my doors?"--and with that she seized
my arm.  "What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,
shipmate?"

In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side
of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--"No!  I
haven't seen it since I put it there."  Running to a little closet
under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told
me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  "He's killed himself," she
cried.  "It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another
counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my
house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,
go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--"no
suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;"--might as
well kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his
ghost!  What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!"

And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
open the door.

"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the
locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast!" putting
her hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess;
let's see."  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!
Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

"Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a
little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again
vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and
with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.

With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;
right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding
Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other
way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter
with you?"

"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.

But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was
almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally
constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so
for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular
meals.

"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you
please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."

Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he
could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move
a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my
presence in the slightest way.

I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;
do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be
so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him
rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for
ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't
believe it's very punctual then.

I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the
long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding
voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a
schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic
Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly
eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by
this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a
termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had
not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so
downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half
the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his
head.

"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg."
But not a word did he reply.

Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous
to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over
him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but
his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could
not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the
mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that
uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me
really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room
with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable
Ramadan!

But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break
of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as
if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first
glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating
joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;
pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was
over.

Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's
religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or
insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it
also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a
positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an
uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that
individual aside and argue the point with him.

And just so I now did with Queequeg.  "Queequeg," said I, "get into
bed now, and lie and listen to me."  I then went on, beginning with
the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to
the various religions of the present time, during which time I
labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and
prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark
nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in
short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,
too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and
sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now
so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,
argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;
and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such
melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,
said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an
undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the
hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.

I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a
great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great
battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two
o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.

"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew
the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor
who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the
custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all
the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,
they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like
a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in
their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all
his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas
turkeys.

After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that
such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical
pagan piety.

At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously
hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady
should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out
to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with
halibut bones.



CHAPTER 18

His Mark.


As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,
Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice
loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my
friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no
cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their
papers.

"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

"I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."

"Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head
from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  "He must show that he's
converted.  Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art
thou at present in communion with any Christian church?"

"Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church."
Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket
ships at last come to be converted into the churches.

"First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships in
Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?" and so saying, taking
out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look
at Queequeg.

"How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not
very long, I rather guess, young man."

"No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it
would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."

"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of
Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?  I never saw him going there, and I
pass it every Lord's day."

"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said
I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."

"Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with
me--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee mean?
answer me."

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.  "I mean, sir, the same
ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of
us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish
some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we
all join hands."

"Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
"Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a
fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.  Deacon
Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's
reckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the
papers.  I say, tell Quohog there--what's that you call him? tell
Quohog to step along.  By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got
there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.  I
say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head
of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"

Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--

"Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him?
well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp aim at
it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean
across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of
sight.

"Now," said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, "spos-ee him
whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead."

"Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
gangway.  "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers.  We
must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.  Look
ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than
ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."

So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready
for signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't
know how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign
thy name or make thy mark?

But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;
so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his
appellative, it stood something like this:--

Quohog.
his X mark.

Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing
Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge
pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,
and selecting one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to
Lose," placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the
book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, "Son of
darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship,
and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still
clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,
remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the
hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;
oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!"

Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.

"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our
harpooneer," Peleg.  "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it
takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint
pretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest
boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the
meeting, and never came to good.  He got so frightened about his
plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear
of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones."

"Peleg!  Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, "thou
thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,
Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou
prate in this ungodly guise.  Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.
Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in
that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with
Captain Ahab, did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?"

"Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.
Think of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
Death and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such
an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking
over us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No!
no time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab and I
was thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig
jury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was
thinking of."

Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
where we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.  Now and then he
stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wasted.



CHAPTER 19

The Prophet.


"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?"

Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.  He was
but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag
of a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent small-pox
had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have
been dried up.

"Have ye shipped in her?" he repeated.

"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, trying to gain a
little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole
arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the
fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

"Yes," said I, "we have just signed the articles."

"Anything down there about your souls?"

"About what?"

"Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickly.  "No matter
though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em;
and they are all the better off for it.  A soul's a sort of a fifth
wheel to a wagon."

"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.

"HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
sort in other chaps," abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
emphasis upon the word HE.

"Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know."

"Stop!" cried the stranger.  "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old
Thunder yet, have ye?"

"Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again riveted with the insane
earnestness of his manner.

"Captain Ahab."

"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"

"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye
hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"

"No, we hav'n't.  He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will
be all right again before long."

"All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
derisive sort of laugh.  "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,
then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."

"What do you know about him?"

"What did they TELL you about him?  Say that!"

"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that
he's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."

"That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough.  But you must jump
when he gives an order.  Step and growl; growl and go--that's the
word with Captain Ahab.  But nothing about that thing that happened
to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days
and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard
afore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing
about the silver calabash he spat into?  And nothing about his losing
his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.  Didn't ye hear a
word about them matters and something more, eh?  No, I don't think ye
did; how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.  But
hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost
it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT every one
knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a
parmacetti took the other off."

"My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must
be a little damaged in the head.  But if you are speaking of Captain
Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I
know all about the loss of his leg."

"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?"

"Pretty sure."

With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on the
papers?  Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will
be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all.  Anyhow, it's
all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go
with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!
Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;
I'm sorry I stopped ye."

"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell
us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."

"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.  Morning to ye,
shipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded
not to make one of 'em."

"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us.
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
great secret in him."

"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."

"Morning it is," said I.  "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this
crazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?"

"Elijah."

Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.  But we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same
corner that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that he was
dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me
imagine.  This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me
all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all
connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;
and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain
Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the
prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves
to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.

I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was
really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with
Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.  But Elijah
passed on, without seeming to notice us.  This relieved me; and once
more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a
humbug.



CHAPTER 20

All Astir.


A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming
on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,
everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a
close.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his
wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the
purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the
hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.

On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given
at all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their
chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how
soon the vessel might be sailing.  So Queequeg and I got down our
traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.  But it
seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship
did not sail for several days.  But no wonder; there was a good deal
to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of,
before the Pequod was fully equipped.

Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,
are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with
whaling, which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide
ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and
bankers.  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet
not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides
the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles
peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of
replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be
remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed
to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss
of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons,
and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate
ship.

At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of
the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,
water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted, for
some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of
divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.

Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and
indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed
resolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting
in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.  At one time she
would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry;
another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where
he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of
some one's rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her
name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.  And
like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle
about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to
anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to
all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was
concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars.

But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming
on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand,
and a still longer whaling lance in the other.  Nor was Bildad himself
nor Captain Peleg at all backward.  As for Bildad, he carried about
with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh
arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,
roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at
the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.

During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
when he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions they
would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.  If
I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very
plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this
way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who
was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out
upon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes
happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly
strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  And much this
way it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.

At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
start.



CHAPTER 21

Going Aboard.


It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when
we drew nigh the wharf.

"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I
to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess;
come on!"

"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.

"Going aboard?"

"Hands off, will you," said I.

"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"

"Ain't going aboard, then?"

"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours?  Do you
know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"

"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
glances.

"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not
to be detained."

"Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?"

"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."

"Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a
few paces.

"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."

But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
that ship a while ago?"

Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,
"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be
sure."

"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah.  "Morning to ye."

Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will
ye?

"Find who?"

"Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off.  "Oh!
I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all
one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it?
Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's
before the Grand Jury."  And with these cracked words he finally
departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his
frantic impudence.

At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in
profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked
within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.
Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle
open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger
there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole
length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded
arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.

"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said
I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the
wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.
But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly
hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;
telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon
the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and
then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.

"Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.

"Oh! perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt
him face."

"Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance
then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,
Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get
off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't
wake."

Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe
passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon
questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand
that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all
sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the
custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to
furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up
eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and
alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much
better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,
perhaps in some damp marshy place.

While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the
tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the
sleeper's head.

"What's that for, Queequeg?"

"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!

He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and
soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping
rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,
it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;
then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;
then sat up and rubbed his eyes.

"Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"

"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"

"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The
Captain came aboard last night."

"What Captain?--Ahab?"

"Who but him indeed?"

I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when
we heard a noise on deck.

"Holloa!  Starbuck's astir," said the rigger.  "He's a lively chief
mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn
to."  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.

It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing
various last things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained
invisibly enshrined within his cabin.



CHAPTER 22

Merry Christmas.


At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's
riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
her last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this,
the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and
turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:

"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab
is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore,
eh?  Well, call all hands, then.  Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"

"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said
Bildad, "but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."

How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,
Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on
the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,
as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no
sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.
But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary
in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.
Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;
and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,
Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;
especially as in the merchant service many captains never show
themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the
anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for
good with the pilot.

But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
Peleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding, and not Bildad.

"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered
at the main-mast.  "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft."

"Strike the tent there!"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,
this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board
the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well
known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

"Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command,
and the crew sprang for the handspikes.

Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the
pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with
Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the
licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself
made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the
ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other
craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking
over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing
what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the
windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in
Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days
previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and
Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each
seaman's berth.

Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he
would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily
I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking
of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a
devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the
thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of
his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp
poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition
of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate
vicinity.  That was my first kick.

"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't
ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with
the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green
pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!"  And so
saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg
very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his
psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something
to-day.

At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It
was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged
into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,
whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long
rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like
the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles
depended from the bows.

Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
steady notes were heard,--

"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
Stand dressed in living green.
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between."


Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.  They
were full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night in
the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,
there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;
and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by
the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,
yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and
perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some
thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which
an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once
more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath
to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to
him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious
strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word
there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the
wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern
Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and
left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically
coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the
hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically
in his face, as much as to say, "Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can
stand it; yes, I can."

As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the
lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin
to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief
mate.

But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.  Back
the main-yard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come close alongside,
now!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.  Luck to
ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye
and good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot
supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!"

"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old
Bildad, almost incoherently.  "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly,
ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
within the year.  Don't forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck,
mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles
are in the green locker!  Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days,
men; but don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's
good gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a
little leaky, I thought.  If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,
beware of fornication.  Good-bye, good-bye!  Don't keep that cheese
too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be careful
with the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--"

"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,
Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.

Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the
lone Atlantic.



CHAPTER 23

The Lee Shore.


Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.

When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her
vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see
standing at her helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe
and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a
four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for
still another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his
feet.  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories
yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of
Bulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the
storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.  The
port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all
that's kind to our mortalities.  But in that gale, the port, the
land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;
one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her
shudder through and through.  With all her might she crowds all sail
off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would
blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for
refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her
bitterest foe!

Know ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the
intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;
while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on
the treacherous, slavish shore?

But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling
infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were
safety!  For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!
Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take
heart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!  Up from the spray
of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!



CHAPTER 24

The Advocate.


As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of
whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be
regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable
pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of
the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.

In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan
society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his
merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if
in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials
S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure
would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.

Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to
a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged
therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.  Butchers we
are, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest
badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably
delights to honour.  And as for the matter of the alleged
uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into
certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the
whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among
the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.  But even granting the
charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all
ladies' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the
popular conceit of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that
many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly
recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into
eddies the air over his head.  For what are the comprehensible
terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of
God!

But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!

But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.

Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling
fleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense,
fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town
some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?  Why
did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in
bounties upwards of L1,000,000?  And lastly, how comes it that we
whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen
in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned
by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the
ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year
importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How
comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?

But this is not the half; look again.

I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his
life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last
sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world,
taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.
One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in
themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,
that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore
offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.  It would be a hopeless,
endless task to catalogue all these things.  Let a handful suffice.
For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting
out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.  She has
explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or
Vancouver had ever sailed.  If American and European men-of-war
now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to
the honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them
the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.  They
may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous
Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and
greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their
succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with
virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and
muskets would not willingly have dared.  All that is made such a
flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,
adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men
accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log.  Ah,
the world!  Oh, the world!

Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
coast.  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous
policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space
permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at
last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the
yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in
those parts.

That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.  After its first
blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
there.  The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
missionaries to their first destinations.  If that double-bolted
land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone
to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.

But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has
no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I
ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a
split helmet every time.

The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
will say.

THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who
wrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And
who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?  Who, but no
less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,
took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those
times!  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?  Who,
but Edmund Burke!

True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have
no good blood in their veins.

NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something better than royal
blood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable.

WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English
statutory law, the whale is declared "a royal fish."*

Oh, that's only nominal!  The whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way.

THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?  In one of the
mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the
world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the
Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed
procession.*


*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.


Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
dignity in whaling.

NO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  The dignity of our calling the very heavens
attest.  Cetus is a constellation in the South!  No more!  Drive
down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg!
No more!  I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred
and fifty whales.  I account that man more honourable than that great
captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.

And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real
repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be
unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon
the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if,
at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any
precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the
honour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College
and my Harvard.



CHAPTER 25

Postscript.


In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts.  But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
blameworthy?

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
functions is gone through.  There is a saltcellar of state, so
called, and there may be a castor of state.  How they use the salt,
precisely--who knows?  Certain I am, however, that a king's head is
solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  Can it
be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior
run well, as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,
concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who
anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.  In truth, a
mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has
probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  As a general rule, he
can't amount to much in his totality.

But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil
is used at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor
macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor
cod-liver oil.  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in
its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?

Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
queens with coronation stuff!



CHAPTER 26

Knights and Squires.


The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and
a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on
an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh
being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his
live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born
in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast
days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers
had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical
superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more
the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the
indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of
the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His
pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,
and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to
come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid
sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted
to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to
see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose
life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a
tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and
fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the
rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep
natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did
therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of
superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,
somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and
inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the
welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from
the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to
those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain
the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more
perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  "I will have no man in my
boat," said Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale."  By this, he
seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage
was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered
peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous
comrade than a coward.

"Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there, is as
careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery."  But we shall
ere long see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a
man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.

Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that
in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple
outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be
foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales
after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much
persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this
critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by
them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck
well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless
deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?

With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck
which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been
extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so
organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he
had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently
engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,
would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.
And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,
visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in
the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary
irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you
from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.

But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to
expose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as
joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there
may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,
is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that
over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to
throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel
within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all
the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the
undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at
such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the
permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the
dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields
a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all
hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!  The great God
absolute!  The centre and circumference of all democracy!  His
omnipresence, our divine equality!

If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them
tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased,
among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if
I shall touch that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if I shall
spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all
mortal critics bear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality,
which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!
Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to
the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst
clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and
paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson
from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst
thunder him higher than a throne!  Thou who, in all Thy mighty,
earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the
kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!



CHAPTER 27

Knights and Squires.


Stubb was the second mate.  He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.  A
happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they
came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent
crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman
joiner engaged for the year.  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he
presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but
a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular
about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an
old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the
whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying
lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.  He
would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
most exasperated monster.  Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted
the jaws of death into an easy chair.  What he thought of death
itself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,
might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that
way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took
it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
themselves there, about something which he would find out when he
obeyed the order, and not sooner.

What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their
packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of
his; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his
short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk
without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes
there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;
and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,
lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading
them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead
of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his
mouth.

I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of
his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as
in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
disinfecting agent.

The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.
A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning
whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had
personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a
sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever
encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for
the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead
to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from
encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was
but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring
only a little circumvention and some small application of time and
trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious
fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of
whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'
voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length
of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and
cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one
of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called
him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be
well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy
concussions of those battering seas.

Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
men.  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
Pequod's boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which
Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,
being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a
picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of
javelins.

And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a
Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or
harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh
lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the
assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a
close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in
this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what
headsman each of them belonged.

First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had
selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.

Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their
largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this
sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of
those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England
moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.
But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the
sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible
arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky
limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son
of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the
second mate's squire.

Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the
sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the
top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily
shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native
coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,
Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and
having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the
ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they
shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in
his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and
a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce
of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus
Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man
beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,
that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the
same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and
military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in
the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I
say, because in all these cases the native American liberally
provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying
the muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the
Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.
In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London,
put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of
their crew.  Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.
How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best
whalemen.  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES
too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but
each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.  Yet now,
federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!  An
Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all
the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them
ever come back.  Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went
before.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall
ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal
time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid
strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a
coward here, hailed a hero there!



CHAPTER 28

Ahab.


For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
seen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other at the
watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they
seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes
issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that
after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.  Yes, their
supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any
eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the
cabin.

Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first
vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion
of the sea, became almost a perturbation.  This was strangely
heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences
uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have
before conceived of.  But poorly could I withstand them, much as in
other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities
of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever it was of
apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet
whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all
warrantry to cherish such emotions.  For though the harpooneers, with
the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and
motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my
previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed
this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very
nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
abandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the three
chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly
calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence
and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,
more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
could not readily be found, and they were every one of them
Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being
Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its
intolerable weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,
but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when
with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a
vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted
to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled
my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his
quarter-deck.

There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,
when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without
consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged
robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,
and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right
down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it
disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly
whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the
straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning
tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels
and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the
soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether
that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,
throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,
especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head
Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was
full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it
came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an
elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this
laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with
preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor
seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab
should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.

So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I
hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing
to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had
previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned
from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  "Aye, he was
dismasted off Japan," said the old Gay-Head Indian once; "but like
his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for
it.  He has a quiver of 'em."

I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side
of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of
firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the
fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he
spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their
minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if
not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And
not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a
crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing
dignity of some mighty woe.

Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his
cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;
either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he
had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;
indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less
a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the
dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,
by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the
air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at
last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But
the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;
nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were
fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of
himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that
one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
upon.

Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
from his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April
and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the
barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send
forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;
so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of
that girlish air.  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom
of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a
smile.



CHAPTER 29

Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.


Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
Tropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
up--flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights
seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden
helmeted suns!  For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such
winsome days and such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of
that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to
the outward world.  Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when
the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals
as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these
subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the
less man has to do with aught that looks like death.  Among
sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths
to visit the night-cloaked deck.  It was so with Ahab; only that now,
of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly
speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to
the planks.  "It feels like going down into one's tomb,"--he would
mutter to himself--"for an old captain like me to be descending this
narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth."

So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night
were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band
below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the
sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some
cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their
slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin
to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the
cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the
iron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some considering touch of
humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained
from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have
been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their
dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.  But once,
the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with
heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to
mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a
certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain
Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but
there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something
indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion
into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
then.

"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me
that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.  Below to thy nightly
grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the
filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"

Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
like it, sir."

"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving
away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

"No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be
called a dog, sir."

"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and
begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"

As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"
muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.
"It's very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know
whether to go back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my
knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;
but it would be the first time I ever DID pray.  It's queer; very
queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the
queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.  How he flashed at me!--his
eyes like powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway there's something on his
mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.
He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the
twenty-four; and he don't sleep then.  Didn't that Dough-Boy, the
steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's
hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the
foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort
of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?  A hot old
man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's
a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.  Well, well;
I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He's
full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every
night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should
like to know?  Who's made appointments with him in the hold?  Ain't
that queer, now?  But there's no telling, it's the old game--Here
goes for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born
into the world, if only to fall right asleep.  And now that I think
of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of
queer, too.  Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em.
But that's against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh
commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes
again.  But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me
ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He
might as well have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick
me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow,
somehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.  What the devil's the
matter with me?  I don't stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of
that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.  By the Lord, I
must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--but the only way's
to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll
see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight."



CHAPTER 30

The Pipe.


When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
his pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the
stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.  How could
one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the
plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was
Ahab.

Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.
"How now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this
smoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if
thy charm be gone!  Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not
pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to
windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,
my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What
business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for
sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not
among torn iron-grey locks like mine.  I'll smoke no more--"

He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed in
the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking
pipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.



CHAPTER 31

Queen Mab.


Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.

"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man's
ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!
And then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool,
kept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know
how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I
somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not
much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the
row?  It's not a real leg, only a false leg.'  And there's a mighty
difference between a living thump and a dead thump.  That's what
makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear
than a blow from a cane.  The living member--that makes the living
insult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,
while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so
confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was
thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone
cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact,
only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.  Besides,'
thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a
small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
THERE'S a devilish broad insult.  But this insult is whittled down to
a point only.'  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.
While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired
old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and
slews me round.  'What are you 'bout?' says he.  Slid! man, but I was
frightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the
fright.  'What am I about?' says I at last.  'And what business is
that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do YOU want a
kick?'  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man,
his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.  Says
I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.'  'Wise
Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a
sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't
going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I
might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.  But I had only just
lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!'
'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?'  'Look ye
here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,
didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'right HERE it was.'  'Very
good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,'
says I.  'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain
of?  Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch
pine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked by a great man,
and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It's an honour; I consider it
an honour.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England the greatest lords
think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made
garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by
old Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say; BE kicked by
him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you
can't help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don't you see that pyramid?'  With
that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
swim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
hammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?"

"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"

"May be; may be.  But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.  D'ye see
Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best
thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to
him, whatever he says.  Halloa!  What's that he shouts?  Hark!"

"Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales
hereabouts!

If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!

"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye mark that,
man?  Look ye--there's something special in the wind.  Stand by for
it, Flask.  Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.  But, mum; he
comes this way."



CHAPTER 32

Cetology.


Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be
lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.  Ere that come to pass;
ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled
hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a
matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding
of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all
sorts which are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
that I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.  The
classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
essayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid
down.

"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.

"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the
inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
families....  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this
animal" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.

"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."
"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea."  "A field
strewn with thorns."  "All these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists."

Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and
Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of
real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and
so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.
Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,
who have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a
few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir
Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;
Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest;
Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;
Bennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and
the Rev.  T.  Cheever.  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all
these have written, the above cited extracts will show.

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate
subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
authority.  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost
unworthy mentioning.  And here be it said, that the Greenland whale
is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any
means the largest of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of
his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years
back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and
which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few
scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every
way complete.  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland
whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But
the time has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing
Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is
deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!

There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
degree succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale's and
Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea
whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter
touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily
small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though
mostly confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the
sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any
literature.  Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
life.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
laborers.  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.  I promise nothing complete;
because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty.  I shall not pretend to a minute
anatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at
least--to much of any description.  My object here is simply to
project the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the
architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
Post-Office is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea
after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations,
ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.  What am
I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!  The awful
tauntings in Job might well appal me.  "Will he the (leviathan) make
a covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!  But I have
swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do
with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will
try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.

First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters
it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his
System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate
the whales from the fish."  But of my own knowledge, I know that down
to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against
Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of
the same seas with the Leviathan.

The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales
from the waters, he states as follows: "On account of their warm
bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow
ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex
lege naturae jure meritoque."  I submitted all this to my friends
Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine
in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons
set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted
they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has
given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm
blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,
a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have
him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not
a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the
definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost
any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have
not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among
spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably
assumes a horizontal position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come
the grand divisions of the entire whale host.


*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins
and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish
are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of
rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,
I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with
their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.


First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
all, both small and large.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,
the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.

FOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--I. The
SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the
HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM
WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the
English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of
the Long Words.  He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the
globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most
majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;
he being the only creature from which that valuable substance,
spermaceti, is obtained.  All his peculiarities will, in many other
places, be enlarged upon.  It is chiefly with his name that I now
have to do.  Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries
ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own
proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained
from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was
popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the
one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was
the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of
the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally
expresses.  In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,
not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.  It
was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of
rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of
spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the
dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely
significant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation must at last
have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is
the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
hunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
baleen; and the oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior
article in commerce.  Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately
designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland
Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right
Whale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the
species thus multitudinously baptised.  What then is the whale, which
I include in the second species of my Folios?  It is the Great
Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the
English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is the whale which for more than
two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the
Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long
pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West
Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right
Whale Cruising Grounds.

Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
English and the right whale of the Americans.  But they precisely
agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a
single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive
differences, that some departments of natural history become so
repellingly intricate.  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of
at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a
monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the
whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing
the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he
attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,
but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to
olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the
intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand
distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is
often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet
long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an
angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the
slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin
will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When
the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical
ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon
the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle
surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy
hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as
some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;
unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen
waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous
power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from
man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his
race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the
baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the
right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,
there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are
little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed
whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are
the fishermen's names for a few sorts.

In connection with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it
is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,
founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;
notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously
seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of
Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the
whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,
back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any
regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and
more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this
same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has
baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the
same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of
whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any
one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy
all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock
every one of the whale-naturalists has split.

But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
Greenland whale.  And if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part
as available to the systematizer as those external ones already
enumerated.  What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the
whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them
that way.  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and
it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is
practicable.  To proceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on
the northern American coast.  He has been frequently captured there,
and towed into harbor.  He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.  At any rate, the
popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.  His oil is not
very valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the most gamesome and
light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water
generally than any other of them.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is
known but his name.  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.  Of
a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.  Though
no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
rises in a long sharp ridge.  Let him go.  I know little more of him,
nor does anybody else.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring
gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along
the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.  He is seldom
seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern
seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his
countenance.  He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks
of line.  Prodigies are told of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can
say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
which present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;
III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.


*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to
them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned
form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo
volume does.


BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose
loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
popularly classed among whales.  But possessing all the grand
distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have
recognised him for one.  He is of moderate octavo size, varying from
fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding
dimensions round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly
hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good
for light.  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory
of the advance of the great sperm whale.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular
fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the
best.  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall
say so, and suggest another.  I do so now, touching the Black Fish,
so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.
So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is well
known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips
are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on
his face.  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in
length.  He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way
of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something
like a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed, the sperm
whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the
supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal
housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.  Though
their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL
WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I
suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked
nose.  The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn
averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to
fifteen feet.  Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,
growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the
horizontal.  But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an
ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a
clumsy left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or
lance answers, it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used
like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors
tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the
bottom of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an
ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar
Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so
breaks through.  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be
correct.  My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may
really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading
pamphlets.  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the
Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious
example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of
animated nature.  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered
that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the
great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it
brought immense prices.  It was also distilled to a volatile salts
for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are
manufactured into hartshorn.  Originally it was in itself accounted
an object of great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin
Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did
gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich
Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; "when Sir Martin
returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees he
presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,
which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor."  An
Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did
likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land
beast of the unicorn nature.

The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
and he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is
precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the
professed naturalist.  From what I have seen of him at a distance,
I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.  He is very
savage--a sort of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the great Folio
whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty
brute is worried to death.  The Killer is never hunted.  I never
heard what sort of oil he has.  Exception might be taken to the name
bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.  For
we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks
included.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous
for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He
mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage
by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a
similar process.  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the
Killer.  Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

DUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.  I. The Huzza
Porpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-mouthed
Porpoise.

To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or
five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the
popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the creatures
set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of
my definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a
horizontal tail.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe.  The name is of my
own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and
something must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus, because
he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep
tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.
Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to
windward.  They are the lads that always live before the wind.  They
are accounted a lucky omen.  If you yourself can withstand three
cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the
spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.  A well-fed, plump Huzza
Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.  But the fine
and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.
It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.  Sailors put it on
their hones.  Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.  It may never
have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so
small that it is not very readily discernible.  But the next time you
have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale
himself in miniature.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.
Very savage.  He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is
somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general
make.  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.  I have lowered
for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
is known.  The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
designated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.
In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of
a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
gentleman-like figure.  He has no fins on his back (most other
porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of
a hazel hue.  But his mealy-mouth spoils all.  Though his entire
back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,
distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the "bright waist,"
that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours,
black above and white below.  The white comprises part of his head,
and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A most mean and mealy
aspect!  His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.


Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.  Above, you have all the
Leviathans of note.  But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
reputation, but not personally.  I shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.
If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,
then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to
his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale;
the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading
Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the
Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.
From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might
be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of
uncouth names.  But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can
hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,
but signifying nothing.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
here, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I have
kept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.  For
small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand
ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.  God keep me
from ever completing anything.  This whole book is but a
draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.  Oh, Time, Strength,
Cash, and Patience!



CHAPTER 33

The Specksynder.


Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a
place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,
arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a
class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.

The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means
Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief
Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to
the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the
whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or
Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,
under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is
still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present
he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the
captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good
conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an
important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night
watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also
his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he
should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in
some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,
by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.

Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships
and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the
captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers
are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take
their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly
communicating with it.

Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the
longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils
of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all
of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,
but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance,
intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases
tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen
generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family
these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for
all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck
are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,
many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in
any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if
he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only
homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though
he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping
upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to
peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be
detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of
condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was
by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.

Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism
of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained
unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became
incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's
intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the
practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of
some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,
more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's
true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the
highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous
more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful
of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over
the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small
things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some
royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.
But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of
geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will
the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its
fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so
important in his art, as the one now alluded to.

But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical
trappings and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand
in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in
the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!



CHAPTER 34

The Cabin-Table.


It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his
lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been
taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the
latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that
daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete
inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not
heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,
he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,
saying, "Dinner, Mr. Starbuck," disappears into the cabin.

When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,
the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the
planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some
touch of pleasantness, "Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle.
The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly
shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with
that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a
rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows after his predecessors.

But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off
his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe
right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,
pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down
rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,
reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new
face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask
enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the
Slave.

It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in
that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not
to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head
of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore
this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,
King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but
courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane
grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit
presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that
man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the
time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for
Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,
has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social
czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this
consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,
then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of
sea-life just mentioned.

Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned
sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but
still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited
to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in
Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With
one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as
he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the
world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest
observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And
when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef
was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the
mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;
and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where
the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial
Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in
awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;
only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,
when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little
Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family
party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have
been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,
this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more
would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask
helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed
it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on
account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he
deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter
was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however
it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!

Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and
Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was
badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start
of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.
If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have
but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his
repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than
three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to
precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted
in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an
officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much
relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and
satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.
I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned
beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.
There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official
capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first
table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in
inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or
rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And
then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its
residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of
the high and mighty cabin.

In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire
care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those
inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,
seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the
harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a
report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like
Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites
had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the
previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a
great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.
And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble
hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And
once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory
by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,
shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the
progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the
standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical
tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life
was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers
furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their
clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at
them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to
the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the
low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes
passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was
wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible
that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the
vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.
But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the
abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in
the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants
made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of
the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the
trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth
lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing
out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the
simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round
him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not
at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that
in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin
should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to
his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;
to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones
jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.

But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before
sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar
quarters.

In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone
that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real
truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be
said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did
enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning
inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a
permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much
hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was
inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of
Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as
the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when
Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking
his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,
shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen
paws of its gloom!



CHAPTER 35

The Mast-Head.


It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with
the other seamen my first mast-head came round.

In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she
may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her
proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'
voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an
empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;
and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,
does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.

Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the
old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to
them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must
doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest
mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was
put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have
gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we
cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And
that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an
assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that
the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory
singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four
sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of
their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and
sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing
out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,
the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone
pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life
on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in
him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by
fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything
out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern
standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top
of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred
and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great
Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that
point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral
Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked
to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they
gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate
through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what
rocks must be shunned.

It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells
us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were
regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island
erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs
ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in
a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay
whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to
the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now
become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a
whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from
sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene
weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,
to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a
hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if
the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your
legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships
once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.
There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy
trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most
part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling
accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of
what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years
and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is
immutable.

In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at
the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much
to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a
portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly
destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or
adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains
to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or
any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men
temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is
the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin
parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant
cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about
as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold
weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a
watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of
its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even
move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an
ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat
is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional
skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in
your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your
watch-coat.

Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of
a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a
Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the
frozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled
"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and
incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of
Old Greenland;" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads
are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then
recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of
Captain Sleet's good craft.  He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in
honour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and
free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call
our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original
inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after
ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet's
crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open
above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to
keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.  Being fixed on the
summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in
the bottom.  On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,
is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,
comforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep
your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in
this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with
him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,
for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea
unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at
them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot
down upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a
labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so
enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a
small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the
errors resulting from what is called the "local attraction" of all
binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of
the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to
there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I
say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here,
yet, for all his learned "binnacle deviations," "azimuth compass
observations," and "approximate errors," he knows very well, Captain
Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that
well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side
of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the
whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and
learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so
utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and
comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
within three or four perches of the pole.

But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.  For one, I
used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to
have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find
there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg
over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery
pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.

Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,
how could I--being left completely to myself at such a
thought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly hold my
obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your
weather eye open, and sing out every time."

And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad
with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;
and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his
head.  Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before
they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you
ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the
richer.  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the
whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and
absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,
and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not
unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless
disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:--

"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!  Ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."

Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling
sufficient "interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so
hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret
souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in
vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is
imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the
visual nerve?  They have left their opera-glasses at home.

"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've
been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a
whale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up
here."  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of
them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like
listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded
youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he
loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the
visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind
and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing
that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some
undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through
it.  In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;
becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled
Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round
globe over.

There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
the inscrutable tides of God.  But while this sleep, this dream is on
ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
identity comes back in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you hover.
And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one
half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the
summer sea, no more to rise for ever.  Heed it well, ye Pantheists!



CHAPTER 36

The Quarter-Deck.


(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)


It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at
that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few
turns in the garden.

Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his
old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all
over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his
walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;
there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints
of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of
his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at
the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that
thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so
completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward
mould of every outer movement.

"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him
pecks the shell.  'Twill soon be out."

The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send
everybody aft.

"Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

"Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab.  "Mast-heads, there! come down!"

When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and
not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not
unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after
rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among
the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were
nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and
half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering
whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,
that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing
a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,
he cried:--

"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"

"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of
clubbed voices.

"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so
magnetically thrown them.

"And what do ye next, men?"

"Lower away, and after him!"

"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"

"A dead whale or a stove boat!"

More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that
they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless
questions.

But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in
his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--

"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a
white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding
up a broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece,
men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."

While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of
his vitality in him.

Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the
main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold
with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever
of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a
crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with
three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of
ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my
boys!"

"Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

"It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
topmaul: "a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out."

All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection.

"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same
that some call Moby Dick."

"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"

"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said
the Gay-Header deliberately.

"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for
a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"

"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
him--him--" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round
and round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him--"

"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a
whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after
the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like
a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye
have seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"

"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus
far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last
seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.
"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick
that took off thy leg?"

"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye,
my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick
that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye," he
shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a
heart-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale
that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!"
Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted
out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the
Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames
before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to
chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of
earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,
men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave."

"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
Moby Dick!"

"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout.  "God bless ye,
men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this
long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?
art not game for Moby Dick?"

"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,
Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we
follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest
it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket
market."

"Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest
a little lower layer.  If money's to be the measurer, man, and the
accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!"

"He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow."

"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,
Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."

"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects,
man, are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living
act, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning
thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the
unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How
can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?
To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I
think there's naught beyond.  But 'tis enough.  He tasks me; he heaps
me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice
sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be
the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak
that hate upon him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the
sun if it insulted me.  For could the sun do that, then could I do
the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy
presiding over all creations.  But not my master, man, is even that
fair play.  Who's over me?  Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine
eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,
so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.
But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays
itself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I
meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish
cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the
sun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things,
that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they
feel!  The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab,
in this matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder
Chilian! he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general
hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?
Reckon it.  'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for
Starbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt, then, the best
lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every
foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize
thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!  Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy
silence, then, THAT voices thee.  (ASIDE) Something shot from my
dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is
mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion."

"God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from
the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the
cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as
for a moment their hearts sank in.  For again Starbuck's downcast
eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh
died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved
and rolled as before.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye
not when ye come?  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye
shadows!  Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications
of the foregoing things within.  For with little external to
constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still
drive us on.

"The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.

Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them before him
near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's
company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.  But those wild eyes met
his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of
their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the
bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.

"Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman.  "The crew alone now drink.  Round with it, round!
Short draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So,
so; it goes round excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye.  Well done; almost drained.  That way it went,
this way it comes.  Hand it me--here's a hollow!  Men, ye seem the
years; so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!

"Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;
and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand
there with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may
in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before
me.  O men, you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies
come not sooner.  Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming
again, were't not thou St. Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!

"Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!
Let me touch the axis."  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so
doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing
intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.  It seemed as
though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have
shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the
Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.  The three mates quailed before
his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.  Stubb and Flask looked
sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.

"In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well.  For did ye three but
once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT
had perhaps expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have
dropped ye dead.  Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now,
ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen
there--yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant
harpooneers.  Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the
feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals!
your own condescension, THAT shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye;
ye will it.  Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"

Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,
barbs up, before him.

"Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them over! know
ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye
cup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!"
Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed
the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

"Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!
Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.
Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to
sit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man
the deathful whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all,
if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!"  The long, barbed steel
goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white
whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.
Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,
the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,
waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired
within his cabin.



CHAPTER 37

Sunset.


THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.


I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er
I sail.  The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let
them; but first I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like
wine.  The gold brow plumbs the blue.  The diver sun--slow dived from
noon--goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless
hill.  Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of
Lombardy.  Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not
its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly
confounds.  'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  'Tis split, too--that
I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against
the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no
helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

Dry heat upon my brow?  Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly
spurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No more.  This lovely light, it
lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er
enjoy.  Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying
power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst
of Paradise!  Good night--good night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM
THE WINDOW.)

'Twas not so hard a task.  I thought to find one stubborn, at the
least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels,
and they revolve.  Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder,
they all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to fire
others, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I've dared,
I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do!  They think me
mad--Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!  That
wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!  The prophecy was
that I should be dismembered; and--Aye!  I lost this leg.  I now
prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.  Now, then, be the
prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's more than ye, ye great gods,
ever were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not say as schoolboys
do to bullies--Take some one of your own size; don't pommel ME!  No,
ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but YE have run and hidden.
Come forth from behind your cotton bags!  I have no long gun to
reach ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can
swerve me.  Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
yourselves! man has ye there.  Swerve me?  The path to my fixed
purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
torrents' beds, unerringly I rush!  Naught's an obstacle, naught's an
angle to the iron way!



CHAPTER 38

Dusk.


BY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.


My soul is more than matched; she's overmanned; and by a madman!
Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field!
But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me!  I
think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.
Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with
a cable I have no knife to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who's over him,
he cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he
lords it over all below!  Oh!  I plainly see my miserable office,--to
obey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!  For in
his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.  Yet is
there hope.  Time and tide flow wide.  The hated whale has the round
watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.
His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside.  I would up
heart, were it not like lead.  But my whole clock's run down; my
heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.


[A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE.]


Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
human mothers in them!  Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea.  The
white whale is their demigorgon.  Hark! the infernal orgies! that
revelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft!  Methinks it
pictures life.  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay,
embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where
he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of
the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.  The long
howl thrills me through!  Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch!
Oh, life!  'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to
knowledge,--as wild, untutored things are forced to feed--Oh, life!
'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis not me!
that horror's out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in
me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures!  Stand by
me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!



CHAPTER 39

First Night Watch.

Fore-Top.

(STUBB SOLUS, AND MENDING A BRACE.)


Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking over it
ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence.  Why so?
Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and
come what will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is,
it's all predestinated.  I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but
to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening
felt.  Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew
it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I
clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, WISE
Stubb--that's my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here's a
carcase.  I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,
I'll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your
horribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!  What's my juicy
little pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--Giving a party
to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate's
pennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!  Oh--

We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,
To love, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,
And break on the lips while meeting.


A brave stave that--who calls?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--(ASIDE)
he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--Aye, aye,
sir, just through with this job--coming.



CHAPTER 40

Midnight, Forecastle.

HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.

(FORESAIL RISES AND DISCOVERS THE WATCH STANDING, LOUNGING, LEANING,
AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES, ALL SINGING IN CHORUS.)

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
Our captain's commanded.--

1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion!  Take a
tonic, follow me!
(SINGS, AND ALL FOLLOW)

Our captain stood upon the deck,
A spy-glass in his hand,
A viewing of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand.
Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
And by your braces stand,
And we'll have one of those fine whales,
Hand, boys, over hand!
So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
Eight bells there, forward!

2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Avast the chorus!  Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy?  Strike
the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch.
I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.  So, so,
(THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
Eight bells there below!  Tumble up!

DUTCH SAILOR.
Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that.  I mark this in
our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to
others.  We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
butts.  At 'em again!  There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em
through it.  Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.  Tell 'em
it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to
judgment.  That's the way--THAT'S it; thy throat ain't spoiled with
eating Amsterdam butter.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in
Blanket Bay.  What say ye?  There comes the other watch.  Stand by
all legs!  Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP.
(SULKY AND SLEEPY)
Don't know where it is.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears.  Jig it, men, I say; merry's
the word; hurrah!  Damn me, won't you dance?  Form, now, Indian-file,
and gallop into the double-shuffle?  Throw yourselves!  Legs! legs!

ICELAND SAILOR.
I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste.  I'm
used to ice-floors.  I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject;
but excuse me.

MALTESE SAILOR.
Me too; where's your girls?  Who but a fool would take his left hand
by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do?  Partners!  I must
have partners!

SICILIAN SAILOR.
Aye; girls and a green!--then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn
grasshopper!

LONG-ISLAND SAILOR.
Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.  Hoe corn when you
may, say I.  All legs go to harvest soon.  Ah! here comes the music;
now for it!

AZORE SAILOR.
(ASCENDING, AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE.)
Here you are, Pip; and there's the windlass-bitts; up you mount!
Now, boys!
(THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE; SOME GO BELOW; SOME SLEEP
OR LIE AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING.  OATHS A-PLENTY.)

AZORE SAILOR.
(DANCING)
Go it, Pip!  Bang it, bell-boy!  Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it,
bell-boy!  Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!

PIP.
Jinglers, you say?--there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.

CHINA SAILOR.
Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.


FRENCH SAILOR.
Merry-mad!  Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!  Split
jibs! tear yourselves!

TASHTEGO.
(QUIETLY SMOKING)
That's a white man; he calls that fun: humph!  I save my sweat.

OLD MANX SAILOR.
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are
dancing over.  I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the
bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
corners.  O Christ! to think of the green navies and the
green-skulled crews!  Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as
you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it.
Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.

3D NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Spell oh!--whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a
calm--give us a whiff, Tash.

(THEY CEASE DANCING, AND GATHER IN CLUSTERS.  MEANTIME THE SKY
DARKENS--THE WIND RISES.)

LASCAR SAILOR.
By Brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon.  The sky-born, high-tide
Ganges turned to wind!  Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!

MALTESE SAILOR.
(RECLINING AND SHAKING HIS CAP.)
It's the waves--the snow's caps turn to jig it now.  They'll shake
their tassels soon.  Now would all the waves were women, then I'd go
drown, and chassee with them evermore!  There's naught so sweet on
earth--heaven may not match it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild
bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe,
bursting grapes.

SICILIAN SAILOR.
(RECLINING.)
Tell me not of it!  Hark ye, lad--fleet interlacings of the
limbs--lithe swayings--coyings--flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all
graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come
satiety.  Eh, Pagan? (NUDGING.)

TAHITAN SAILOR.
(RECLINING ON A MAT.)
Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!--the Heeva-Heeva!  Ah! low
veiled, high palmed Tahiti!  I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft
soil has slid!  I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first
day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite.  Ah me!--not thou
nor I can bear the change!  How then, if so be transplanted to yon
sky?  Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears,
when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?--The blast! the
blast!  Up, spine, and meet it! (LEAPS TO HIS FEET.)

PORTUGUESE SAILOR.
How the sea rolls swashing 'gainst the side!  Stand by for reefing,
hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they'll go
lunging presently.

DANISH SAILOR.
Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest!  Well
done!  The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.  He's no more afraid
than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
He has his orders, mind ye that.  I heard old Ahab tell him he must
always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a
pistol--fire your ship right into it!

ENGLISH SAILOR.
Blood! but that old man's a grand old cove!  We are the lads to hunt
him up his whale!

ALL.
Aye! aye!

OLD MANX SAILOR.
How the three pines shake!  Pines are the hardest sort of tree to
live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the
crew's cursed clay.  Steady, helmsman! steady.  This is the sort of
weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea.
Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in
the sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

DAGGOO.
What of that?  Who's afraid of black's afraid of me!  I'm quarried
out of it!

SPANISH SAILOR.
(ASIDE.) He wants to bully, ah!--the old grudge makes me touchy
(ADVANCING.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of
mankind--devilish dark at that.  No offence.

DAGGOO (GRIMLY).
None.

ST. JAGO'S SAILOR.
That Spaniard's mad or drunk.  But that can't be, or else in his one
case our old Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.

5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
What's that I saw--lightning?  Yes.

SPANISH SAILOR.
No; Daggoo showing his teeth.

DAGGOO (SPRINGING).
Swallow thine, mannikin!  White skin, white liver!

SPANISH SAILOR (MEETING HIM).
Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!

ALL.
A row! a row! a row!

TASHTEGO (WITH A WHIFF).
A row a'low, and a row aloft--Gods and men--both brawlers!  Humph!

BELFAST SAILOR.
A row! arrah a row!  The Virgin be blessed, a row!  Plunge in with
ye!

ENGLISH SAILOR.
Fair play!  Snatch the Spaniard's knife!  A ring, a ring!

OLD MANX SAILOR.
Ready formed.  There! the ringed horizon.  In that ring Cain struck
Abel.  Sweet work, right work!  No?  Why then, God, mad'st thou the
ring?

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails!  Stand by to reef
topsails!

ALL.
The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (THEY SCATTER.)


PIP (SHRINKING UNDER THE WINDLASS).
Jollies?  Lord help such jollies!  Crish, crash! there goes the
jib-stay!  Blang-whang!  God!  Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal
yard!  It's worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of
the year!  Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?  But there they
go, all cursing, and here I don't.  Fine prospects to 'em; they're on
the road to heaven.  Hold on hard!  Jimmini, what a squall!  But
those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white squalls, they.
White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr!  Here have I heard all
their chat just now, and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken
of once! and only this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my
tambourine--that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!
Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have
mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men
that have no bowels to feel fear!



CHAPTER 41

Moby Dick.


I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the
rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted,
and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my
soul.  A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's
quenchless feud seemed mine.  With greedy ears I learned the history
of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken
our oaths of violence and revenge.

For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them knew of
his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
battle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of
whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the
entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their
quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole
twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling
sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the
irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other
circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread
through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be
doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such
or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great
mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some
minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in
question must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the
Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly
gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,
were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it
were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the
individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter
between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.

And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by
chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had
every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,
as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such
calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained
wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal
to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,
all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those
things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to
whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.

Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the
more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not
only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all
surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its
fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,
wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them
to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so
the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the
wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate
there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that
ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all
sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact
with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face
they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle
to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a
thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to
any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of
the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a
calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending
to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.

No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit
over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale
did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid
hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,
which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from
anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic
did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had
heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to
encounter the perils of his jaw.

But there were still other and more vital practical influences at
work.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the
Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There
are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
whaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm
Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those
prows which stem him.

And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only
to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to
be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human
blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or
almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the
Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish
(sharks included) are "struck with the most lively terrors," and
"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against
the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death."  And
however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports
as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty
item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some
vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.

So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier
days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to
induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this
new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other
leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance
at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.
That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick
eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may
be consulted.

Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number
who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle
if offered.

One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be
linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously
inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;
that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one
and the same instant of time.

Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For
as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been
divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of
the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,
unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated
the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a
great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the
most widely distant points.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,
and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by
Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the
Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted
in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of
these instances it has been declared that the interval of time
between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.
Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the
Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to
the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living
men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in
which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still
more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose
waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an
underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whalemen.

Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some
whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring
Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but
ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in
his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should
ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a
ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of
leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.

But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough
in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to
strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much
his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm
whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white
wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were
his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,
uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to
those who knew him.

The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his
distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally
justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through
a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all
spangled with golden gleamings.

Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet
his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his
assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of
dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his
exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had
several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down
upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back
in consternation to their ship.

Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though
similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means
unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White
Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or
death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been
inflicted by an unintelligent agent.

Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds
of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of
chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out
of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,
exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in
the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,
had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly
sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had
reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No
turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with
more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that
ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild
vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his
frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all
his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual
exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac
incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel
eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the
beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east
reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship
it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred
white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that
most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all
truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to
crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable
in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all
the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and
then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's
shell upon it.

It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise
at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at
the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,
passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that
tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but
nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards
home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that
dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and
gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.
That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,
that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the
fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in
his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,
that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he
sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the
mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable
latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the
tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium
seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth
from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he
bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm
orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was
now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human
madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you
think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still
subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in
his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had
been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great
natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became
the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his
special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned
all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from
having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear
upon any one reasonable object.

This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains
unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is
profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked
Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now
quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast
Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of
man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits
in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned
on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that
captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his
frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye
prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family
likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from
your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.

Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my
means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to
kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind
he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of
his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his
will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that
dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no
Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and
that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken
him.

The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness
which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on
the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very
unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling
voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of
that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those
very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a
pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.
Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting
fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would
seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the
most appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be
corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem
superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
attack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad
secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and
all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in
him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!  They were bent on
profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
mint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
revenge.

Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with
curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,
chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and
cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere
unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable
jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading
mediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially
picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his
monomaniac revenge.  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to
the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much
their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the
White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,
also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding
great demon of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to
dive deeper than Ishmael can go.  The subterranean miner that works
in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever
shifting, muffled sound of his pick?  Who does not feel the
irresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
still?  For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and
the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.



CHAPTER 42

The Whiteness of The Whale.


What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,
which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm,
there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror
concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely
overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable
was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.
But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,
random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be
naught.

Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the
barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the
White Elephants" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of
dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white
quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the
one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,
Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour
the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to
the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,
noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though
among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum
was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness
typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and
contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine
spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white
forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek
mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white
bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of
the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their
theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest
envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of
their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for
white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and
though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially
employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the
Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the
four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for
all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul
than that redness which affrights in blood.

This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,
when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any
object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest
bounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of
the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
transcendent horrors they are?  That ghastly whiteness it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than
terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.  So that not the
fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as
the white-shrouded bear or shark.*


*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened
hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that
the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in
the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing
together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear
frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.  But even assuming all
this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not
have that intensified terror.

As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in
that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies
with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is
most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that
fish.  The Romish mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam"
(eternal rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any
other funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness
of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the
French call him REQUIN.


Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,
unflattering laureate, Nature.*


*I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during a
prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.  From my
forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,
dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of
unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.  At
intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace
some holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.  Though
bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in
supernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,
methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham
before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its
wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the
miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.  Long I gazed
at that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell, can only hint, the things
that darted through me then.  But at last I awoke; and turning, asked
a sailor what bird was this.  A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had
heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is
utterly unknown to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned
that goney was some seaman's name for albatross.  So that by no
possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
our deck.  For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird
to be an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish
a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.

I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.

But how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not, and I will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the
sea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,
leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and
then letting it escape.  But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant
for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join
the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!


Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.  He was the
elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of
his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings
more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished
him.  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,
western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters
revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic
as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.  Whether
marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts
that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether
with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon,
the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils
reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented
himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling
reverence and awe.  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on
legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual
whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that
this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at
the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.

But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
Albatross.

What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often
shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and
kin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by
the name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--has no
substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading
whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.
Why should this be so?

Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
crowning attribute of the terrible.  From its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
Squall.  Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary.  How wildly it heightens the effect
of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of
their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their
bailiff in the market-place!

Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.  It
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.  And
from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
shroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions do we
fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts
rising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us
add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the
evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.

Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.

But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
account for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.  Can we,
then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing
of whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part
stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught
fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same
sorcery, however modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some
chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?

Let us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.
And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions
about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few
perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore
may not be able to recall them now.

Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
with new-fallen snow?  Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant
of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a
White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?

Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White
Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
neighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer
towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is
full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of
all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert
such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea
lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on
the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?
Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to
the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
does "the tall pale man" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless
pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves--why is
this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the
Blocksburg?

Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her
wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all
adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban
avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack
of cards;--it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the
strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the
white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her
woe.  Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;
admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her
broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own
distortions.

I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
universality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
respectively elucidated by the following examples.

First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock
to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky
whiteness--as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white
bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious
dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him
as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off
soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue
water is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell
thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as
the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?"

Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such
vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it
would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same is
it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative
indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no
shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.  Not
so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at
times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost
and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows
speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless
churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and
splintered crosses.

But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
hypo, Ishmael.

Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley
of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon
the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,
so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal
muskiness--why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the
ground in phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of
any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the
strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated
with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New
England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?

No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though thousands of miles
from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending,
goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.

Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the
shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!

Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the
mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,
somewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects
this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were
formed in fright.

But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
in things the most appalling to mankind.

Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with
the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the
milky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a
colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the
concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a
dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a
colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink?  And when we
consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all
other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet
tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of
butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are
but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only
laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints
like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself,
and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,
even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this,
the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind
at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around
him.  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?



CHAPTER 43

Hark!


"HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?

It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing
in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the
waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  In this manner, they
passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.  Standing, for the most
part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were
careful not to speak or rustle their feet.  From hand to hand, the
buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional
flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
Cholo, the words above.

"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"

"Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"

"There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--it
sounded like a cough."

"Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket."

"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers
turning over, now!"

"Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It's the three soaked
biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.
Look to the bucket!"

"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."

"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old
Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
you're the chap."

"Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is
somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;
and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  I heard Stubb
tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort
in the wind."

"Tish! the bucket!"



CHAPTER 44

The Chart.


Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall
that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then
seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the
various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but
steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were
blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside
him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on
various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been
captured or seen.

While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over
his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for
ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled
brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out
lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was
also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his
forehead.

But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they
were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,
and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans
before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a
view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of
his soul.

Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it
seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and
thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,
also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting
him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,
almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be
upon this or that ground in search of his prey.

So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
flights of swallows.  On this hint, attempts have been made to
construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*


*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it
appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
portions of it are presented in the circular.  "This chart divides
the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees
of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are
twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days
that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two
others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,
have been seen."


Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,
the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,
secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are
called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any
chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these
cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a
surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly
confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary
VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces
some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to
expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the
whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic
zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and
along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked
for.

And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in
crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,
by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to
be wholly without prospect of a meeting.

There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,
perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular
seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude
that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude
this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those
that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar
and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved
true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,
applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm
whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for
example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,
or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that
were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,
too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed
himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and
ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And
where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been
spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,
antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or
place were attained, when all possibilities would become
probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were
conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For
there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the
sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one
sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly
encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were
storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the
monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But
in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with
which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he
would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning
fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;
nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.

Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of
the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her
commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the
next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing
had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this
very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous
hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far
remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his
wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China
Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,
Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter
and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag
world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.

But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the
peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could
not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab
would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long
after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,
and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out
like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a
breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came
over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover
his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure
who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps
with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his
palms.

Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably
vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts
through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and
whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till
the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and
when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved
his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from
which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends
beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself
yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and
with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though
escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of
being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright
at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.
For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast
hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,
was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror
again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;
and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing
mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or
agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity
of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an
integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the
soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up
all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that
purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against
gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its
own.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to
which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and
unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of
bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the
time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of
living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
therefore a blankness in itself.  God help thee, old man, thy
thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart
for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.



CHAPTER 45

The Affidavit.


So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance
of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural
verity of the main points of this affair.

I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
these citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally
follow of itself.

First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by
the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
private cypher, have been taken from the body.  In the instance where
three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and
I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage
to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and
penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of
nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,
poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to
wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he
had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice
circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of
Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came
together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have
known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw
the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons
with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead
fish.  In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the
boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly
recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which
I had observed there three years previous.  I say three years, but I
am pretty sure it was more than that.  Here are three instances,
then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many
other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
good ground to impeach.

Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however
ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several
memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean
has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such
a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to
his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for
however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon
put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down
into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from
the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige
of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo
Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him
by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered
lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more
intimate acquaintance.  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to
know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the
acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their
presumption.

But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it
not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,
who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose
spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it not so, O
New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their
wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!
King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the
semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?  Was it not so, O
Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with
mystic hieroglyphics upon the back!  In plain prose, here are four
whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
Sylla to the classic scholar.

But this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at
various times creating great havoc among the boats of different
vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,
chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their
anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out
through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his
mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost
warrior of the Indian King Philip.

I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.  For
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires
full as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of
some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that
without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and
otherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a
monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and
intolerable allegory.

First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed,
vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they
recur.  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual
disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a
public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten
that record.  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this
moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea,
is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding
leviathan--do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in
the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?
No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.
In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct
or indirect from New Guinea?  Yet I tell you that upon one particular
voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty
different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some
of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.
For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a
gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for
it.

Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues
of Egypt.

But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this: The
Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and
judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,
utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm
Whale HAS done it.

First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of
Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw
spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.
Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very
large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore
directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,
he so stove her in, that in less than "ten minutes" she settled down
and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.
After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in
their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more
sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second
time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he
has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a
resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of
the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and
faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this
within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*


*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact
seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance
which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the
ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to
their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being
made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for
the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were
necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had
just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his
companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings."  Again:
"At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening
before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my
mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied
that I am correct in my opinion."

Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
black night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore.  "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;
the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the
dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its
appearance."

In another place--p. 45,--he speaks of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL
ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."


Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
allusions to it.

Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then
commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to
be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship
in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon
whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the
amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen
present.  He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so
smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a
thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.  Some weeks after,
the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But
he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few
moments' confidential business with him.  That business consisted in
fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps
going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.
I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview
with that whale as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted
from unbelief by a similar fright?  I tell you, the sperm whale will
stand no nonsense.

I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little
circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.
Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian
Admiral Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of
the present century.  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth
chapter:

"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next
day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather
was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged
to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;
it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest
sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger
than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was
not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,
which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was
impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed
in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up
its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The
masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck
upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with
the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately
to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any
damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped
entirely uninjured."

Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in
Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by
no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,
and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he
sailed from home.

In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that
just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here
for a corroborative example, if such be needed.

Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he calls
the modern Juan Fernandes.  "In our way thither," he says, "about
four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,
which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell
where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for
death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we
took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the
amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found
no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in
their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their
hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown
out of his cabin!"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in
the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after
all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from
beneath.

I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known
to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In
more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the
assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,
and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The
English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for
his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the
lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been
transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her
great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.
Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once
struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with
blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his
mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive
minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding
illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you
will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that
these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so
that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is
nothing new under the sun.

In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian
magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor
and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his
own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best
authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and
unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not
at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.

Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having
destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more
than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot
easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what
precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he
destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a
whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will
tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had
been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters
connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a
place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations
have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been
isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the
Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary
coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a
sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the
Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out
of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.

In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements
together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for
half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
probability have been a sperm whale.



CHAPTER 46

Surmises.


Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to
that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature
and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,
altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or
at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives
much more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,
perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his
vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended
itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters
he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each
subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he
hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there
were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly
according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no
means incapable of swaying him.

To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used
in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He
knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some
respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the
complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority
involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the
intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's
body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept
his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the
chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,
would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.
It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was
seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall
into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,
unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were
brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of
Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested
than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for
the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange
imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full
terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted
meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long
night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the
savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors
of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in
the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when
retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene
and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.

Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are
evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the
manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the
White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and
playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous
knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give
chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,
daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of
old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to
fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had
they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that
final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in
disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of
cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,
and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same
quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
soon cashier Ahab.

Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the
possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,
Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.  That
protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and
heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew
to be subjected to.

For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a
good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the
Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but
force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the
general pursuit of his profession.

Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the
three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and
not omit reporting even a porpoise.  This vigilance was not long
without reward.



CHAPTER 47

The Mat-Maker.


It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured
waters.  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a
sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and
subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an
incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor
seemed resolved into his own invisible self.

I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I
kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a
dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the
sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it
seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle
mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the
fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,
unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of
the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.  This warp
seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.
Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting
the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the
case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow
producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the
completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally
shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword
must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise
incompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp
of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every
alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still
free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though
restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and
sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed
to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring
blow at events.


Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the
clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.  High aloft in the
cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His body was reaching
eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief
sudden intervals he continued his cries.  To be sure the same sound
was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from
hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air; but from
few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a
marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian's.

As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild
cries announcing their coming.

"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"

"Where-away?"

"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!"

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus.

"There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
disappeared.

"Quick, steward!" cried Ahab.  "Time! time!"

Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
minute to Ahab.

The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading
to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in
advance of our bows.  For that singular craft at times evinced by the
Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he
nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and
swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his
could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that
the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew
at all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected for
shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time
relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The sailors at the fore
and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places;
the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high
cliffs.  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the
gunwale.  So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw
themselves on board an enemy's ship.

But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who
was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of
air.



CHAPTER 48

The First Lowering.


The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other
side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose
the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had
always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called
the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one
white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.  A rumpled
Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide
black trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely crowning this
ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair
braided and coiled round and round upon his head.  Less swart in
aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of
the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,
and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and
secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,
whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.

While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these
strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their
head, "All ready there, Fedallah?"

"Ready," was the half-hissed reply.

"Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck.  "Lower away
there, I say."

Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks;
with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the
tossed boats below.

Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth
keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,
and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.  But with all their
eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates
of the other boats obeyed not the command.

"Captain Ahab?--" said Starbuck.

"Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats.  Thou,
Flask, pull out more to leeward!"

"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
great steering oar.  "Lay back!" addressing his crew.
"There!--there!--there again!  There she blows right ahead,
boys!--lay back!"

"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."

"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.
Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?  And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it?
What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."

"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of
whom still showed signs of uneasiness.  "Why don't you break your
backbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in yonder
boat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands come to help us--never
mind from where--the more the merrier.  Pull, then, do pull; never
mind the brimstone--devils are good fellows enough.  So, so; there
you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's the
stroke to sweep the stakes!  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my
heroes!  Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don't be
in a hurry--don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap your oars, you
rascals?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly,
softly!  That's it--that's it! long and strong.  Give way there, give
way!  The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all
asleep.  Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,
can't ye? pull, won't ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and
ginger-cakes don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and
start your eyes out!  Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his
girdle; "every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the
blade between his teeth.  That's it--that's it.  Now ye do something;
that looks like it, my steel-bits.  Start her--start her, my
silver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"

Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially
in inculcating the religion of rowing.  But you must not suppose from
this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright
passions with his congregation.  Not at all; and therein consisted
his chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his
crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury
seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman
could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and
yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time
looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his
steering-oar, and so broadly gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the
mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,
acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those
odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously
ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of
obeying them.

In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.

"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!"

"Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
like a flint from Stubb's.

"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!

"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: "A
sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never
mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,
come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm
ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)
Sperm, sperm's the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit hand
in hand."

"Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so.  Aye, and
that's what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy
long suspected.  They were hidden down there.  The White Whale's at
the bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!  Can't be helped!  All
right!  Give way, men!  It ain't the White Whale to-day!  Give way!"

Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical
instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not
unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of
the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time
previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this
had in some small measure prepared them for the event.  It took off
the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and
Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were
for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair
still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to
dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.  For me,
I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on
board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.  Those
tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like
five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of
strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a
horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for
Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown
aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole
part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end
of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward
into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was
seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat
lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at once the
outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,
while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.  Boat and
crew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in
the rear paused on their way.  The whales had irregularly settled
bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token
of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed
it.

"Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck.  "Thou,
Queequeg, stand up!"

Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the
savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off
towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.  Likewise
upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly
platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly
and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of
a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still;
its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
the level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns with
the whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a
man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed
perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her
trucks.  But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same
time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that
this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.

"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
that."

Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his
lofty shoulders for a pedestal.

"Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?"

"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
fifty feet taller."

Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm
to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed
head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one
dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.
And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm
furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself
by.

At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what
wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an
erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most
riotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see
him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such
circumstances.  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic
Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,
indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to
every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.  On his
broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer
looked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,
ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;
but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly
chest.  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living
magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
seasons for that.

Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
solicitudes.  The whales might have made one of their regular
soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were
the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to
solace the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from
his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.  He
loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly
had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand,
when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his
erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry,
"Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"

To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath
this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin
layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of
all the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed
their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.

All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air.  But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills.

"Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed
glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed
as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did
not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to
him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly
pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now
soft with entreaty.

How different the loud little King-Post.  "Sing out and say
something, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!  Beach me,
beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll
sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including
wife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I
shall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that white water!"  And so
shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on
it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally
fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt
from the prairie.

"Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has.
Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em.
Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you
know;--merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.
But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and
steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack
all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.  Take it
easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and
lungs!"

But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew
of his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
blessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel sharks in
the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado
brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after
his prey.

Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific allusions of
Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its
tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like,
that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful
look over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the
oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their
necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and
no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.

It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that
almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip
into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to
gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down
its other side;--all these, with the cries of the headsmen and
harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the
wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with
outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all
this was thrilling.

Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the
fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering
the first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can
feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the
first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of
the hunted sperm whale.

The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun
cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapour no longer
blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed
separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck
giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was
now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat
going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could
scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the
row-locks.

Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
ship nor boat to be seen.

"Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
sheet of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the
squall comes.  There's white water again!--close to!  Spring!"

Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,
when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: "Stand
up!" and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death
peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense
countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the
imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing
sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the
boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and
hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.

"That's his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.

A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron
of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push
from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the
sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near
by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The
whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter
into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and
harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the
iron, escaped.

Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming
round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the
gunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in
the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our
downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up
to us from the bottom of the ocean.

The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers
together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us
like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were
burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the
other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a
flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the
driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;
no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all
attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,
performing now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the
lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a
waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
forlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle
in the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the
sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in
the midst of despair.

Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or
boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still
spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of
the boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand
to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards
hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the
thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we
all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing
right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its
length.

Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant
it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base
of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen
no more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were
dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had
cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The
ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light
upon some token of our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.



CHAPTER 49

The Hyena.


There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and
more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.
He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,
all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an
ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.  And
as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden
disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem
to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side
bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.  That odd sort of
wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of
extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,
so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most
momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.  There is
nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort
of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this
whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.

"Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
water; "Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
happen?"  Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me,
he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.

"Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb,
I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our
chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.  I
suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set
in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?"

"Certain.  I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
Cape Horn."

"Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
close by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not.  Will
you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr.
Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself
back-foremost into death's jaws?"

"Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask.  "Yes, that's the law.  I
should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
that!"

Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate
statement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls
and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,
were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering
that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I
must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the
boat--oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his
impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own
frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our
own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving
on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in
the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent
Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a devil's chase I
was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together,
I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of
my will.  "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my lawyer,
executor, and legatee."

It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
more fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth time in my nautical
life that I had done the same thing.  After the ceremony was
concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone
was rolled away from my heart.  Besides, all the days I should now
live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his
resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks
as the case might be.  I survived myself; my death and burial were
locked up in my chest.  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly,
like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of
a snug family vault.

Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my
frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,
and the devil fetch the hindmost.



CHAPTER 50

Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.


"Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb; "if I had but one
leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the
plug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"

"I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said
Flask.  "If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different
thing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of
the other left, you know."

"I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel."


Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
perils of the chase.  So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears
in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be
carried into the thickest of the fight.

But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of
danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great
and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed,
then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any
maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing,
the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.

Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little
of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes
of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and
giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat
actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above
all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same
boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the
heads of the owners of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a
boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on
that head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own
touching all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery, the
sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a
little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary
business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after
this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one
of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden
skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the
groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and
particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in
the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed
pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in
exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes
called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee
against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter's
chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there;
all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at
the time.  But almost everybody supposed that this particular
preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the
ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a
supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any
boat's crew being assigned to that boat.

Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the
unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating
outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer
castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits
of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and
what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step
down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create
any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.

But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it
were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah
remained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly
world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced
himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to
have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might
have been even authority over him; all this none knew.  But one
cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was such a
creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see
in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and
then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the
Oriental isles to the east of the continent--those insulated,
immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days
still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal
generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct
recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,
eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon
why they were created and to what end; when though, according to
Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the
devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.



CHAPTER 51

The Spirit-Spout.


Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
locality, southerly from St. Helena.

It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was
seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the
moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god
uprising from the sea.  Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of
these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast
head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it
had been day.  And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night,
not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.  You
may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old
Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the
moon, companions in one sky.  But when, after spending his uniform
interval there for several successive nights without uttering a
single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was
heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner
started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the
rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.  "There she blows!"  Had the
trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still
they felt no terror; rather pleasure.  For though it was a most
unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
lowering.

Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.  The
best man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every mast-head
manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.  The strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the
hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel
like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two
antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct
to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.  And
had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that
in him also two different things were warring.  While his one live
leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb
sounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.
But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like
arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen
that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second
time.

This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some
days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:
again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,
once more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served
us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the
case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or
three; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be
advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet
seemed for ever alluring us on.

Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things
invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore
that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in
however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was
cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time,
there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting
apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in
order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last
in the remotest and most savage seas.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas
so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our
vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like
prow.

But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
dismal than before.

Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and
thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable
sea-ravens.  And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these
birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time
obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some
drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and
therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.  And heaved
and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast
tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish
and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as
called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that
before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this
tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and
these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any
haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.  But
calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of
feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary
jet would at times be descried.

During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
addressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these, after
everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done
but passively to await the issue of the gale.  Then Captain and crew
become practical fatalists.  So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
eyelashes together.  Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part
of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a
loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as
if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through
all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.  By night
the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean
prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still
wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.  Even when wearied nature seemed
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.
Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night
going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him
with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the
rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time
before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and
coat.  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of
tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.  His lantern
swung from his tightly clenched hand.  Though the body was erect, the
head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the
needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*


*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
of the course of the ship.


Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.



CHAPTER 52

The Albatross.


South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good
cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney
(Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at
the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to
a tyro in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent
from home.

As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides, this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees
furred over with hoar-frost.  Only her lower sails were set.  A wild
sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three
mast-heads.  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and
bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of
cruising.  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and
swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided
close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,
mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.

"Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?"

But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove
to make himself heard without it.  Meantime his ship was still
increasing the distance between.  While in various silent ways
the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this
ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's name
to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though
he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the
threatening wind forbade.  But taking advantage of his windward
position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that
the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he
loudly hailed--"Ahoy there!  This is the Pequod, bound round the
world!  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!
and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address
them to--"

At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,
then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small
harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming
by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged
themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks.  Though in the
course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed
a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles
capriciously carry meanings.

"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the
water.  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed
more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before
evinced.  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding
the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old
lion voice,--"Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!"

Round the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire proud
feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?  Only
through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where
those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.

Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could
for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and
strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were
promise in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we
dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time
or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this
round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave
us whelmed.



CHAPTER 53

The Gam.


The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we
had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.  But even had
this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it
had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
answer to the question he put.  For, as it eventually turned out, he
cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger
captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so
absorbingly sought.  But all this might remain inadequately
estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of
whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and
especially on a common cruising-ground.

If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a
moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a
while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon
the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two
whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off
lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more
natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not
only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things
to talk about.

For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters
on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers
of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files.  And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
importance to her.  And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground
itself, even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one
of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and
now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
people of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would exchange the
whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.  For not only would they
meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the
peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually
shared privations and perils.

Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small
number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and
when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between
them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he
does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides,
the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan
superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean
Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of
sea-peasant.  But where this superiority in the English whalemen
does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees
in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,
collectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in
the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much
to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles
himself.

So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.  Whereas,
some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic,
will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of
recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a
brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in
finical criticism upon each other's rig.  As for Men-of-War, when
they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of
silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there
does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly
love about it at all.  As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are
in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as
possible.  And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other's
cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many skulls?"--the same way that
whalers hail--"How many barrels?"  And that question once answered,
pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on
both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each other's villanous
likenesses.

But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
free-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a "GAM," a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
and repeat gamesome stuff about "spouters" and "blubber-boilers," and
such like pretty exclamations.  Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,
and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors,
cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a
question it would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of
pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs
has any peculiar glory about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon
elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.  And besides, when a man
is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his
superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be
high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no
solid basis to stand on.

But what is a GAM?  You might wear out your index-finger running up
and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.  Dr.
Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not
hold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many
years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born
Yankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be
incorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view, let me learnedly
define it.

GAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY
ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE
VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON
BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.

There is another little item about Gamming which must not be
forgotten here.  All professions have their own little peculiarities
of detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate, man-of-war, or
slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always
sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat
there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's
tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.  But the whale-boat has
no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.
High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water
on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.  And as for a
tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and
therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,
and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that
subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing
like a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious of
the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of
the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance
of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  Nor is this any
very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering
oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar
reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.  He is thus completely
wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by
settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of
the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.  Merely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then,
again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,
it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen
steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything
with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,
he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps
being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for
ballast.  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well
authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an
uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize
hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim
death.



CHAPTER 54

The Town-Ho's Story.


(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)


The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,
is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you
meet more travellers than in any other part.

It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.  She was
manned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that ensued
she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general interest
in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the
Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a
certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called
judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.  This
latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming
what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be
narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.  For
that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the
Town-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three confederate
white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that
way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those
seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by
such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this
matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast.  Interweaving in its proper
place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on
lasting record.


*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the
mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos
terrapin.


For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
Inn.  Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,
were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions
they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am
about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of
Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days'
sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was
somewhere to the northward of the Line.  One morning upon handling
the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made
more water in her hold than common.  They supposed a sword-fish had
stabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain, having some unusual reason
for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and
therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then
considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it
after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy
weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working
at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more
days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
sensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm, the
captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the
islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.

"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep
the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.  In
truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very
prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in
perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least
fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the
mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,
a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.

"'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'
said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your
courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.  Now,
gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had
yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions
popularly connected with the open ocean.  For in their interflowing
aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,
and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like
expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of
its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain round
archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in
large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the
Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous
territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;
here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like
craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings
of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild
barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in
Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of
prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar
Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as
well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant
ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech
canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as
any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out
of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a
midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though
an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;
as much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in
his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to
nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed
our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite
as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh
from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this
Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had
long been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved
so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,
gentlemen, you shall hear.

"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again
increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
every day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like
our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping
their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should
the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,
the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at
their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if
any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a
leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,
some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a
little anxious.

"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was
found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern
manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,
and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,
was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of
nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,
unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently
imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about
the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only
on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were
working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any
mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across
the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
scupper-holes.

"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this
conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person
placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very
significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway
against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and
bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize
that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be
this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt
was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing
golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's
snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,
gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son
to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;
yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,
and Steelkilt knew it.

"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on
with his gay banterings.

"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!
I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had
best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,
boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a
gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and
the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at
the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here
now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing
the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old
soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his
property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a
poor devil like me the model of his nose.'

"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at
it!'

'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,
lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty
fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that
peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest
tension of life's utmost energies.

"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman
went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his
face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from
his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed
Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated
state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along
the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the
planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters
consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.

"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of
household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly
attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case
of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the
inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in
seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing
their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the
prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,
it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into
gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman
of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of
the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial
business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you
may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.

"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost
as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had
spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat
still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's
malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in
him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and
unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already
ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really
valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,
gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.

"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that
sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And
then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three
lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the
pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied
with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner
unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the
still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he
had snatched from a cask near by.

"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,
for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating
Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow
still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he
remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed
Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously
commanding him to do his bidding.

"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round
the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking
him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to
yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,
where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an
inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable
maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;
stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,
Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing
it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek
he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been
branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer
touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was
stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.

"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheads.  They were both Canallers.

"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whale-ships in our
harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon: who and what are
they?'

"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
You must have heard of it.'

"'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and
hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'

"'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's very fine; and
ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for
such information may throw side-light upon my story.'

"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities
and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps,
and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by
billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great
forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;
by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery
of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white
chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one
continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life.
There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where
you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,
and the snug patronising lee of churches.  For by some curious
fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that
they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen,
most abound in holiest vicinities.

"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into
the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.

"'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in
Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'

"'A moment!  Pardon!' cried another of the company.  'In the name of
all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we
have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present
Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow
and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this
coast--"Corrupt as Lima."  It but bears out your saying, too;
churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open--and
"Corrupt as Lima."  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city
of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your
cup!  Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'

"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would
make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
he.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,
flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his
red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny
deck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.  The brigandish
guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and
gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.  A terror to the
smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond
on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these
Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it
is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor
stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.  In sum,
gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically
evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its
most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except
Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.  Nor does
it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition
between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly
ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.

"'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his
chicha upon his silvery ruffles.  'No need to travel!  The world's
one Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the
generations were cold and holy as the hills.--But the story.'

"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.
Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior
mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.  But
sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed
into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the
forecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,
and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way, the
valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon
his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him
along to the quarter-deck.  At intervals, he ran close up to the
revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it
with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.  But
Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they
succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.

"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing
them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.
'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'

"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the
signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.  Fearing in
his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little
desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to
their duty.

"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their
ringleader.

"'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!  Do you want
to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?  Turn to!' and
he once more raised a pistol.

"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her sink.  Not a man of
us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.
What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was their
response.

"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his
eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--'It's
not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away;
it was boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him
not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here
against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the
forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.
Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool;
forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're
your men; but we won't be flogged.'

"'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!'

"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's
not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but
we won't be flogged.'

"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.

"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you
what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;
but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's
turn.'

"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there
till ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'

"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them were
against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded
him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears
into a cave.

"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the
Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over
the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and
loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock
belonging to the companionway.

Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down
the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in
number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
remained neutral.

"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward
and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;
at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
breaking through the bulkhead below.  But the hours of darkness
passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling
hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through
the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.

"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.  Water
was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit
were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and
pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.  Twice every
day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a
confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary
summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the
forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.  The fetid closeness
of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of
ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
discretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to
the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his
babbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning
three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.  Only three were
left.

"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.

"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.

"'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.

"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that
had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place
as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt
proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with
him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the
garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,
heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the
bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation
possible, seize the ship.  For himself, he would do this, he said,
whether they joined him or not.  That was the last night he should
spend in that den.  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part
of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any
other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was
more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the
time to make the rush should come.  But to this their leader as
fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly
as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the
matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but
admit one man at a time.  And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these
miscreants must come out.

"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same
piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in
order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to
surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such
conduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his determination
still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle
chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;
and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls
to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,
and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at
midnight.

"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,
the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his
perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man
who had been fully ripe for murder.  But all these were collared, and
dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were
seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and
there they hung till morning.  'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing
to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye
villains!'

"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
former that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon
the whole, he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for
the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go
with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.

"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the
rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and,
seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their
heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.

"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is
still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give
up.  Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say
for himself.'

"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
sort of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me,
I murder you!'

"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off
with the rope to strike.

"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.

"'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.

"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the
Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the
deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his
rope, said, 'I won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'

But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
man, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.
Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,
hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had
watched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth, that he
could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing
and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the
rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.

"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.

"'So I am, but take that.'  The mate was in the very act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He paused: and then
pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat,
whatever that might have been.  The three men were then cut down, all
hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the
iron pumps clanged as before.

"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running
up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the
crew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at
their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for
salvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.  On
the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they
had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders
to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all
agreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case
any should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her
other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her
captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on
the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate
was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his
bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.

"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.  He was in
Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to
run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the
rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,
upon resuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one or
two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of
his revenge.

"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.
In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.  There was a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
this was the sea.  Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the
morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.  At
his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very
carefully in his watches below.

"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.

"'What do you think? what does it look like?'

"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'

'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
before him; 'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven't enough
twine,--have you any?'

"But there was none in the forecastle.

"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.

"'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor.

"'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help
himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at
him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.  It
was given him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the
next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the
pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat
into his hammock for a pillow.  Twenty-four hours after, his trick at
the silent helm--nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave
always ready dug to the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to
come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was
already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed
in.

"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
deed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had, and without being
the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to
step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he
would have done.

"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the
second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid
Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted
out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!'  Jesu, what a whale!  It was
Moby Dick.

"'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor, but do
whales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?'

"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,
Don;--but that would be too long a story.'

"'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.

"'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.  Let me get
more into the air, Sirs.'

"'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks
faint;--fill up his empty glass!'

"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen, so
suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
ship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of
the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily
lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it
had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was
now a phrensy.  'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from
captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,
were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the
dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of
the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,
shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.
Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these
events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it
was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in
the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start;
and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he
strained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast,
and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was always a
furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to
beach him on the whale's topmost back.  Nothing loath, his bowsman
hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two
whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a
sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.  That
instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,
and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into
the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the
spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale
rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his
jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went
down.

"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had
slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
looking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,
downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.
He cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance, Moby Dick
rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught
in the teeth that had destroyed him.  All four boats gave chase
again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary
place--where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the
Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately
deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a
large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some
other harbor.

"The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain
called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of
heaving down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting
vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites
necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard
work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,
they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put
off with them in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his
officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded
and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the
poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their
peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.

"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.  He steered away from
it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.
The captain presented a pistol.  With one foot on each prow of the
yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that
if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in
bubbles and foam.

"'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.

"'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded
Steelkilt; 'no lies.'

"'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'

"'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.'  With that
he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
stood face to face with the captain.

"'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me.
As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
island, and remain there six days.  If I do not, may lightning strike
me!'

"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!' and
leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck
befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the
sailor headed.  They embarked; and so for ever got the start of
their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal
retribution.

"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.  Chartering a small
native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisings.

"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses
to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him.

"'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.

"'I am, Don.'

"'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
this your story is in substance really true?  It is so passing
wonderful!  Did you get it from an unquestionable source?  Bear with
me if I seem to press.'

"'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.

"'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
gentlemen?'

"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who
will quickly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you well
advised? this may grow too serious.'

"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'

"'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the
company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the
archiepiscopacy.  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see
no need of this.'

"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized
Evangelists you can.'


'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don
Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.

"'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, further into the
light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.

"'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,
gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true.  I know it to
be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew;
I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"



CHAPTER 55

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.


I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to
the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is
moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon
there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to
those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the
present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is
time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures
of the whale all wrong.

It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions
will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian
sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times
when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,
and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in
scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.
George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license
prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in
many scientific presentations of him.

Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost
endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and
pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages
before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in
some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there
shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate
department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the
form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though
this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the
tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It
looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms
of the true whale's majestic flukes.

But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing
Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the
model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in
painting the same scene in his own "Perseus Descending," make out one
whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster
undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has
a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into
which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate
leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the
Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as
depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.
What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding
like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped
and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and
new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though
universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this
book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended
when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old
Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
species of the Leviathan.

In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the
title-page of the original edition of the "Advancement of Learning"
you will find some curious whales.

But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at
those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific
delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of
voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book
of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in
the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master."
In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are
represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over
their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made
of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.

Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round
Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
Spermaceti Whale Fisheries."  In this book is an outline purporting
to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale
from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on
deck."  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for
the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let
me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the
accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye
of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant
captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!

Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for
the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness
of mistake.  Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature."
In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an
alleged "whale" and a "narwhale."  I do not wish to seem inelegant,
but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as
for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in
this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine
upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.

Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great
naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All
these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or
Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a
long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have
its counterpart in nature.

But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which
he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing
that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your
summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm
Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had
the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he
derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his
scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his
authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort
of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
saucers inform us.

As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the
shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally
Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full
of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
paint.

But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings
have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as
correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would
correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride
of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their
full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated
himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and
significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and
afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched
line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally
impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to
preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of
the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking
whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of
one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is
then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that
his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.

But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at
all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.
Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the
library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a
burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other
leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be
inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the
great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same
relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does
to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity
is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will
be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the
side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular
bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all
these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
fingers in an artificial covering.  "However recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be
truly said to handle us without mittens."

For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must
needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the
world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait
may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with
any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly
way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And
the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his
living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you
run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your
curiosity touching this Leviathan.



CHAPTER 56

Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of
Whaling Scenes.


In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I
pass that matter by.

I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.  In the
previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.  Huggins's
is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale's is the best.
All Beale's drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle
figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping
his second chapter.  His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales,
though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some
parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.  Ross Browne are pretty
correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved.  That is not
his fault though.

Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but
they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.
He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad
deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well
done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living
whale as seen by his living hunters.

But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they
represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first
engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,
just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and
bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the
stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is
drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that
prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an
oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,
and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the
whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub
floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered
about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the
black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this
whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw
so good a one.

In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls
are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing
through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,
and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught
nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is
all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is
the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of
the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
inserted into his spout-hole.

Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life for it
he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.  The French are
the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of
Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and
breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at
Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the
consecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash
of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors
dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a
place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.

The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and
engravings they have of their whaling scenes.  With not one tenth of
England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of
that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations
with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real
spirit of the whale hunt.  For the most part, the English and
American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the
mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the
whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is
about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even
Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff
full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of
classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;
and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the
inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified
Arctic snow crystals.  I mean no disparagement to the excellent
voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it
was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.

In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two
other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes
himself "H.  Durand."  One of them, though not precisely adapted to
our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.
It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French
whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on
board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the
palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless
air.  The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its
presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of
oriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:
the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the
act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a
boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about
giving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons and lances lie
levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.  From the ship,
the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the
smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,
rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the
activity of the excited seamen.



CHAPTER 57

Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in
Mountains; in Stars.


On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen
a crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted
board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
leg.  There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)
is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any time these
ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and
exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.  But the time of his
justification has now come.  His three whales are as good whales as
were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as
unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.
But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech
does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully
contemplating his own amputation.

Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and
Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,
and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the
numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of
the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.  Some of them
have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially
intended for the skrimshandering business.  But, in general, they
toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent
tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in
the way of a mariner's fancy.

Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a
man to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called
savagery.  Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.
I myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.

Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his
domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry.  An ancient
Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and
elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as
a Latin lexicon.  For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a
shark's tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been
achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.

As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.  With
the same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth,
of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone
sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its
maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield; and full
of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old
Dutch savage, Albert Durer.

Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs
of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
forecastles of American whalers.  Some of them are done with much
accuracy.

At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales
hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door.  When the porter
is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.  But these knocking
whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.  On the spires of
some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed
there for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that
are to all intents and purposes so labelled with "HANDS OFF!" you
cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of
the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks
against them in a surf of green surges.

Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.  But you must
be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but
if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and
take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first
stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills,
that your precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious
re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita,
though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera
chronicled them.

Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace
out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them;
as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw
armies locked in battle among the clouds.  Thus at the North have I
chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the
bright points that first defined him to me.  And beneath the
effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined
the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of
Hydrus and the Flying Fish.

With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons
for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies,
to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents
really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!



CHAPTER 58

Brit.


Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast
meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right
Whale largely feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us,
so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and
golden wheat.

On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure
from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws
sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing
fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that
manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.

As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so
these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and
leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*


*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks" does
not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.


But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
all reminded one of mowers.  Seen from the mast-heads, especially
when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black
forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else.
And as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a
distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants
without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened
elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first
time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.  And even
when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can
possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that
lives in a dog or a horse.

Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore.  For
though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the
land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general
view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties,
where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in
disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog?  The
accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear
comparative analogy to him.

But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra
incognita, so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to
discover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the
most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and
indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who
have gone upon the waters; though but a moment's consideration will
teach, that however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and
however much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may
augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea
will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of
these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness
of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.

The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a
widow.  That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the
wrecked ships of last year.  Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is
not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.

Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
miracle upon the other?  Preternatural terrors rested upon the
Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground
opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever
sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships
and crews.

But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but
it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host
who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself
hath spawned.  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle
overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales
against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split
wrecks of ships.  No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider,
the masterless ocean overruns the globe.

Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.  Consider also the
devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless
tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks.
Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose
creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the
world began.

Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most
docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you
not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?  For as this
appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man
there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed
by all the horrors of the half known life.  God keep thee!  Push not
off from that isle, thou canst never return!


CHAPTER 59

Squid.


Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on
her way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air
impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three
tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three
mild palms on a plain.  And still, at wide intervals in the silvery
night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.

But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost
preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any
stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed
a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the
slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this
profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by
Daggoo from the main-mast-head.

In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher
and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed
before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.  Thus
glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.  Then once
more arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale; and yet is
this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on
re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every
man from his nod, the negro yelled out--"There! there again! there
she breaches! right ahead!  The White Whale, the White Whale!"

Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time
the bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab
stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in
readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance
in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm
of Daggoo.

Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect
the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the
particular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his
eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner
did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick
intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.

The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down, and while,
with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the
same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.  Almost forgetting
for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most
wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to
mankind.  A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a
glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long
arms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest
of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within
reach.  No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable
token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the
billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.

As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck
still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild
voice exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,
than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"

"What was it, Sir?" said Flask.

"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
and returned to their ports to tell of it."

But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the
vessel; the rest as silently following.

Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it
with portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all
of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet
very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its
true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to
the sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales
find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of
feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones
below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell
of what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely
pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms
of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty
feet in length.  They fancy that the monster to which these arms
belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that
the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in
order to attack and tear it.

There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner in
which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,
with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two
correspond.  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the
incredible bulk he assigns it.

By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.



CHAPTER 60

The Line.


With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well
as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere
presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible
whale-line.

The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,
slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp
more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more
convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the
ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close
coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are
beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's
durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and
gloss.

Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though
not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and
elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),
is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a
dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a
golden-haired Circassian to behold.

The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.  At first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.  By
experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one
hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain
nearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common sperm whale-line
measures something over two hundred fathoms.  Towards the stern of
the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the
worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of
concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or
minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.  As the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is
used in stowing the line in its tub.  Some harpooneers will consume
almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high
aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub,
so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and
twists.

In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs.  There is some advantage in
this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily
into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American
tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes
a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch
in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,
which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very
much of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped
on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off
with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.

Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.
First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional
line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound
so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally
attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is
shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the
other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its
consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common
safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached
to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end
almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down
after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no
town-crier would ever find her again.

Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting
crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs
against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as
they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks
or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden
pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping
out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and
is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms
(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues
its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then
attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected
with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes
through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.

Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the
timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the
deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son
of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen
intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him
that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these
horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot
be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in
his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange
thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry
mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over
your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of
the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six
burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you
may say.

Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually
chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by
the line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out, to be seated
then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold
whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and
shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit
motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking
like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the
slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
never pierce you out.

Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;
and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the
fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose
of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before
being brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of
true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why
say more?  All men live enveloped in whale-lines.  All are born with
halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,
sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle,
ever-present perils of life.  And if you be a philosopher, though
seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more
of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,
and not a harpoon, by your side.



CHAPTER 61

Stubb Kills a Whale.


If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,
to Queequeg it was quite a different object.

"When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
bow of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'parm whale."

The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing
special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the
spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.  For this part of the
Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen
call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of
porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of
more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the
in-shore ground off Peru.

It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
in what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;
in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went
out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum
will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.

Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So
that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for
every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the
slumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;
and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the
sun over all.

Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices
my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency
preserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under
our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in
the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy
back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a
mirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and
anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a
portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,
poor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the
sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into
wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the
vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth
the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
the sparkling brine into the air.

"Clear away the boats!  Luff!" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own
order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the
spokes.

The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few
ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be
alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man
must speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the
gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the
calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as
we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail
forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower
swallowed up.

"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed
by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a
respite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had
elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the
smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb
counted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the
whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of
cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,
and oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb
cheered on his crew to the assault.

Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his
jeopardy, he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting
from the mad yeast which he brewed.*


*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.
Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant
part about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and
invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is
the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the
tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely
elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from
a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York
pilot-boat.


"Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty
of time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,"
cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  "Start her, now;
give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my
boy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the
word--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,
and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,
boys--that's all.  Start her!"

"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
which the eager Indian gave.

But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.
"Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards
on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.

"Ka-la!  Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
mouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the
keels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the
van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the
smoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they
strained, till the welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give
it to him!"  The harpoon was hurled.  "Stern all!"  The oarsmen
backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along
every one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant
before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round
the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a
hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes
from his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so
also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through
and through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or
squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had
accidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged
sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it
out of your clutch.

"Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
it.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
Stubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering
business truly in that rocking commotion.


*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
bailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the
most convenient.


From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
would have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,
the other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing
elements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a
ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion
from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking
craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they
rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent
being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the
steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his
centre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as
they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
his flight.

"Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
yet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,
Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart
after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat
alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,
and then ranging up for another fling.

The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks
down a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,
which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The
slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back
its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other
like red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was
agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff
after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,
hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb
straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the
gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.

"Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath.  "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat ranged
along the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly
churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,
carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel
after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which
he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold
watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is
struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing
called his "flurry," the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,
overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the
imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to
struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
day.

And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and
contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized
respirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it
had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and
falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into
the sea.  His heart had burst!

"He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.

"Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,
stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.



CHAPTER 62

The Dart.


A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.

According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat
pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as
temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the
foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a
strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for
often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be
flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however
prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to
pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to
set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by
incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while
all the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is
none know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very
heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this
straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at
once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and
give it to him!"  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round
on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with
what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into
the whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,
that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;
no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and
disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how
can you expect to find it there when most wanted!

Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical
instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and
harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent
jeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change
places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,
takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.

Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from
first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
obvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a
slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
harpooneer that has caused them.

To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of
this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not
from out of toil.



CHAPTER 63

The Crotch.


Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in
productive subjects, grow the chapters.

The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent
mention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in
length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale
near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden
extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly
projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to
its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a
backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have
two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first
and second irons.

But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.
It is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that
owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale
upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the
harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the
second iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already
connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon
must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve
all hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;
the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making
this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this
critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal
casualties.

Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the
lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all
directions.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until
the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.

Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is
supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the
first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these
particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to
elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in
scenes hereafter to be painted.



CHAPTER 64

Stubb's Supper.


Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a
calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen
men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish
corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at
long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the
enormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of
Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on
the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile
an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
laden with pig-lead in bulk.

Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly
eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
morning.

Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a
thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not
one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would
have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands
were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being
dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is
to be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the
bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's
and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars
and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together
like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains
standing.*


*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored
alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density
that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the
side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low
beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from
the boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is
ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden
float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other
end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is
made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having
girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and
being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad
flukes or lobes.


If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be
known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,
betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an
unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official
superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of
affairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,
was soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was
somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his
palate.

"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and
cut me one from his small!"

Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a
general thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the
enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before
realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some
of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular
part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering
extremity of the body.

About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti
supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor
was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling
their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of
sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its
fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled
by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few
inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just
see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black
waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge
globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This
particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such
an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened
to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.

Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,
sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like
hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to
bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while
the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving
each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,
the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely
carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you
to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much
the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough
for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders
of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting
alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or
a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like
instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and
occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when
you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more
jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a
whaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend
your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the
expediency of conciliating the devil.

But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
his own epicurean lips.

"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length, widening
his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his
supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if
stabbing with his lance; "cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!"

The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,
came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,
which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;
this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of
command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's
sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on
his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at
the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best
ear into play.

"Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather overdone?  You've been
beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.  Don't I always
say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those
sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and
rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;
tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in
moderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own
voice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this
lantern," snatching one from his sideboard; "now then, go and preach
to 'em!"

Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the
deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low
over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the
other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the
side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,
softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.

"Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!  Massa
Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but
by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!"

"Cook," here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden
slap on the shoulder,--"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear
that way when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners,
cook!"

"Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself," sullenly turning to go.

"No, cook; go on, go on."

"Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:"-

"Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax 'em to it; try that,"
and Fleece continued.

"Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de
tail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin'
and bitin' dare?"

"Cook," cried Stubb, collaring him, "I won't have that swearing.
Talk to 'em gentlemanly."

Once more the sermon proceeded.

"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame ye so much for;
dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,
dat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in
you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark
well goberned.  Now, look here, bred'ren, just try wonst to be cibil,
a helping yourselbs from dat whale.  Don't be tearin' de blubber out
your neighbour's mout, I say.  Is not one shark dood right as toder
to dat whale?  And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale;
dat whale belong to some one else.  I know some o' you has berry brig
mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de
small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid,
but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get
into de scrouge to help demselves."

"Well done, old Fleece!" cried Stubb, "that's Christianity; go on."

"No use goin' on; de dam willains will keep a scougin' and slappin'
each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't hear one word; no use a-preaching
to such dam g'uttons as you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and
dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont
hear you den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on de
coral, and can't hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber."

"Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the
benediction, Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."

Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
shrill voice, and cried--

"Cussed fellow-critters!  Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;
fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die."

"Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; "stand
just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay
particular attention."

"All 'dention," said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in
the desired position.

"Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go
back to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are
you, cook?"

"What dat do wid de 'teak," said the old black, testily.

"Silence!  How old are you, cook?"

"'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.

"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?" rapidly bolting
another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a
continuation of the question.  "Where were you born, cook?"

"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."

"Born in a ferry-boat!  That's queer, too.  But I want to know what
country you were born in, cook!"

"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.

"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.
You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a
whale-steak yet."

"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one," he growled, angrily, turning
round to depart.

"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit
of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
should be?  Take it, I say"--holding the tongs towards him--"take it,
and taste it."

Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old
negro muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."

"Cook," said Stubb, squaring himself once more; "do you belong to the
church?"

"Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.

"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,
and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb.
"Where do you expect to go to, cook?"

"Go to bed berry soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.

"Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful
question.  Now what's your answer?"

"When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly, changing his
whole air and demeanor, "he hisself won't go nowhere; but some
bressed angel will come and fetch him."

"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And
fetch him where?"

"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
keeping it there very solemnly.

"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
you are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it
gets?  Main-top, eh?"

"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.

"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where
your tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven
by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you
don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.
It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.  But
none of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my
orders.  Do ye hear?  Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other
a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook.  What! that
your heart, there?--that's your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that's
it--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention."

"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as
desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears
in front at one and the same time.

"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
don't you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak
for my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so
as not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand, and
show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear?
And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure
you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.
As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now ye
may go."

But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.

"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
D'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
go.--Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don't forget."

"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale.  I'm bressed
if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself," muttered the old
man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his
hammock.



CHAPTER 65

The Whale as a Dish.


That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp,
and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems
so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the
history and philosophy of it.

It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
prices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of
the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce
to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a
species of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine
eating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard
balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for
turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very
fond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.

The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men
like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have
rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their
most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as
being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that
certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland
by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months
on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after
trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are
called "fritters"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'
dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look
that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.

But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to
be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating
as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a
solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and
creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a
cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply
a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method
of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the
seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them
fry there awhile.  Many a good supper have I thus made.

In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
dish.  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the
two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two
large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a
most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,
which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that
some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon
calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,
so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads; which,
indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why
a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is
somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort
of reproachfully at him, with an "Et tu Brute!" expression.

It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the
consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly
murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no
doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a
murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by
oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if
any murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead
quadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's
jaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more
tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his
cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,
civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground
and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.

But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what
is that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the
very ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after
devouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with
what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of
Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within
the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to
patronise nothing but steel pens.



CHAPTER 66

The Shark Massacre.


When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a
general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business
of cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious
one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about
it.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the
helm a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till
daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches
shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the
crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.

But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan
will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks
gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,
say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by
morning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish
do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times
considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp
whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some
instances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.
But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;
though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have
looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole
round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.

Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper
was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle
seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the
sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,
and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light
over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long
whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by
striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only
vital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling
hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought
about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They
viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like
flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be
oppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was
unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A
sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very
joints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had
departed.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one
of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried
to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.


*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best
steel; is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general
shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;
only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably
narrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as
possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a
razor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,
is inserted for a handle.


"Queequeg no care what god made him shark," said the savage,
agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; "wedder Fejee god or
Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin."



CHAPTER 67

Cutting In.


It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio
professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod
was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You
would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the
sea gods.

In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other
ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted
green, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of
grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower
mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.  The end
of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then
conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles
was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,
weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in
stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their
long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of
the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a
broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,
and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence
heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the
entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like
the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,
quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more
she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at
last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship
rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle
rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of
the first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale
precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the
body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.
For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps
the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in
one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the "scarf,"
simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;
and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft
till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then
cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping
mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one
present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may
box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.

One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen
weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he
dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the
swaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating
great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,
in order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished
swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a
scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,
lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the
short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The
heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is
slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main
hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
blubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass
of plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles
hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass
heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the
mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing
occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.



CHAPTER 68

The Blanket.


I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
of the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced
whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion
remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.

The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already
you know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the
consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic
and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen
inches in thickness.

Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,
yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a
presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping
layer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost
enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be
but the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you
may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent
substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only
it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to
being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes
rather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use
for marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;
and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself
with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is
pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you
may say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same
infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the
entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin
of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were
simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous
whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.
But no more of this.

Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this
skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk
of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in
quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only
three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea
may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere
part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.
Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net
weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.

In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least
among the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over
obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
engravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,
as if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In
some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as
in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other
delineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those
mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that
is the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive
memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was
much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters
chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the
Upper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked
whale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks
reminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which
the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the
back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,
altogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those
New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear
the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I
should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm
Whale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in
the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for
I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the
species.

A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in
long pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is
very happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his
blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an
Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is
by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is
enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,
times, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in
those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy
surtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those
Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,
lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that
warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter
would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs
and warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it
then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom
corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful
that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in
those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are
sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the
hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more
surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the
blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in
summer.

It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself
after the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,
live in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep
thy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and
like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
thine own.

But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of
erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few
vast as the whale!



CHAPTER 69

The Funeral.


Haul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!

The vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of
the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in
hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still
colossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it
torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed
with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so
many insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless
phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that
it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of
fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the
almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the
unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and
on, till lost in infinite perspectives.

There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures
all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
speckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I
ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his
funeral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of
earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.

Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid
man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the
distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the
white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high
against it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling
fingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS
HEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun
the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.  There's
your law of precedents; there's your utility of traditions; there's
the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on
the earth, and now not even hovering in the air!  There's orthodoxy!

Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real
terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic
to a world.

Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts than
the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
in them.



CHAPTER 70

The Sphynx.


It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.  Now, the beheading of
the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which
experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not
without reason.

Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a
neck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,
in that very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also,
that the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet
intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost
hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and
bursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward
circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that
subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into
the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear
of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a
critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not
marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to
behead a sperm whale?

When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
cable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small
whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,
with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's
head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to
suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a
whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn
in jewellers' scales.

The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
was hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,
so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native
element.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,
by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and
every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;
there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the
giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.

When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
below to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous
but now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal
yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless
leaves upon the sea.

A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
from his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's
Decapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the
half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,
and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.

It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.  "Speak, thou
vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ungarnished
with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,
mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all
divers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper
sun now gleams, has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where
unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;
where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with
bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,
there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver
never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless
mothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the
locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart
they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven
seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by
pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on
unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.
O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an
infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"

"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.

"Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  "That
lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
man.--Where away?"

"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
to us!

"Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that
way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!  O Nature, and O soul
of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not
the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning
duplicate in mind."



CHAPTER 71

The Jeroboam's Story.


Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster
than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.

By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned
mast-heads proved her a whale-ship.  But as she was so far to
windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other
ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was
set to see what response would be made.

Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
vessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the
whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,
even at considerable distances and with no small facility.

The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's
setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of
Nantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the
Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the
side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the
visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his
boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,
and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's
company.  For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and
though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea
and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to
the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come
into direct contact with the Pequod.

But this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the
Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep
parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by
this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,
indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the
boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully
brought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the
like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between
the two parties; but at intervals not without still another
interruption of a very different sort.

Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
notabilities make up all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish
man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
yellow hair.  A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded
walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were
rolled up on his wrists.  A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in
his eyes.

So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
exclaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the
Town-Ho's company told us of!"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to this
account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the
scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost
everybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:

He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which
he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.  A strange,
apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for
Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed
a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand
candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage.  They engaged him; but
straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his
insanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the
archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He
published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the
deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the
dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the
preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel
in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere
of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.  As such a man,
however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he
refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would
fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's
intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel
forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all
hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried
out.  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that
at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel
was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.  He was
therefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they permit
Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it
came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The
consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or
nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken
out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,
as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but
according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,
cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his
instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are
true.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his
measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But
it is time to return to the Pequod.

"I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to
Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."

But now Gabriel started to his feet.

"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!  Beware of the
horrible plague!"

"Gabriel!  Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either--"  But
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its
seethings drowned all speech.

"Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat
drifted back.

"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!  Beware of the
horrible tail!"

"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--"  But again the boat tore ahead
as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a
succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those
occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.
Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,
and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than
his archangel nature seemed to warrant.

When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions
from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that
seemed leagued with him.

It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon
speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the
existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking
in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against
attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his
gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being
than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But
when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from
the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter
him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and
forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one
iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,
was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies
of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,
while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with
all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild
exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for
his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the
bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc
in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty
yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any
oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.

It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which
the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.
But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances
than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of
violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.

The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the
vial!"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further
hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with
added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit
one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless
terror to the ship.

Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to
him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To
which Ahab answered--"Aye."  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more
started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently
exclaimed, with downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the
blasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"

Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have
just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
officers, if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag."

Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only
received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.

Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely
tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a
letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.

"Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab.  "Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's
but a dim scrawl;--what's this?"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck
took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the
end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the
boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.

Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--yes, Mr.
Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.
Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"

"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but
let me have it."

"Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going
that way."

"Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab.  "Captain Mayhew, stand by now
to receive it"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands,
he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
boat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from
rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,
as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager
hand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and
impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to
give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat
rapidly shot away from the Pequod.

As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the
jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to
this wild affair.



CHAPTER 72

The Monkey-Rope.


In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now
hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There
is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time
everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him
who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our
way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in
the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original
hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and
weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was
inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,
as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special
purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require
that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing
or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies
almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated
upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the
poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the
water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On
the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a
shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as
will presently be seen.

Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the
bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful
duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon
the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a
dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did
I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called
in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas
belted round his waist.

It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we
proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my
narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the
time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,
then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,
it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese
ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;
nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the
hempen bond entailed.

So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and
that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into
unmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort
of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could
have so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I
jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would
threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that
breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese
connexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,
you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your
pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you
may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of
life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.
Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the
management of one end of it.*


*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the
Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.  This
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
monkey-rope holder.


I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the
incessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only
jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made
upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly
allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the
carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
them.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and
then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of
what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still
another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,
Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of
keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they
could reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very
disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best
happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from
the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half
hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs
would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I
suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor
Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life
into the hands of his gods.

Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters
it, after all?  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us
men in this whaling world?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is
Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what
between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor
lad.

But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For
now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at
last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
consolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,
ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!

"Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
"Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet untasted cup.
Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards
the astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you
have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
ginger?  Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is
ginger?--sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer
matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil is ginger, I say, that
you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here."

"There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
come from forward.  "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of
it, if you please."  Then watching the mate's countenance, he added,
"The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and
jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward
an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters
by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"

"I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."

"Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug it
harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to
poison us, do ye?  You have got out insurances on our lives and want
to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"

"It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought
the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any
spirits, but only this ginger-jub--so she called it."

"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
the lockers, and get something better.  I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
Starbuck.  It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a
whale."

"Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but--"

"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something
of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.  What were you about
saying, sir?"

"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."

When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
sort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,
and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and
that was freely given to the waves.



CHAPTER 73

Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.


It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side.  But we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
it.  For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now
for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture
of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not
commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed
numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now
that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the
surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should
be captured that day, if opportunity offered.

Nor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit.  Pulling
further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the
men at the mast-head.  But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great
heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft
that one or both the boats must be fast.  An interval passed and the
boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards
the ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the
hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly
going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly
disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.  "Cut, cut!" was
the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on
the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's
side.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not
sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the
same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.
For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take
them under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.
And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift
tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the
strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under
her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,
that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the
whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to
fly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his
course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him, so that they performed a complete circuit.

Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's
body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking
at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting
fountains that poured from the smitten rock.

At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his
flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,
some conversation ensued between them.

"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard," said
Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with
so ignoble a leviathan.

"Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's
bow, "did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm
Whale's head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a
Right Whale's on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that
ship can never afterwards capsize?"

"Why not?

"I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying
so, and he seems to know all about ships' charms.  But I sometimes
think he'll charm the ship to no good at last.  I don't half like
that chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort
of carved into a snake's head, Stubb?"

"Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of
a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;
look down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion
of both hands--"Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the
devil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his
having been stowed away on board ship?  He's the devil, I say.  The
reason why you don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of
sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.  Blast him!
now that I think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the
toes of his boots."

"He sleeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any hammock; but
I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging."

"No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do
ye see, in the eye of the rigging."

"What's the old man have so much to do with him for?"

"Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose."

"Bargain?--about what?"

"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
he'll surrender Moby Dick."

"Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?"

"I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.  Well,
he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.  The devil,
switching his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.'  'What for?' says
the old governor.  'What business is that of yours,' says the devil,
getting mad,--'I want to use him.'  'Take him,' says the
governor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the
Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I'll eat this whale
in one mouthful.  But look sharp--ain't you all ready there?  Well,
then, pull ahead, and let's get the whale alongside."

"I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."

"Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?
Did ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?"

"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now, tell me,
Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,
was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"

"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn't the devil
live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?  Did you ever
see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?  And if the devil
has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he
can crawl into a porthole?  Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"

"How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"

"Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's
the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold, and
string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,
that wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age.  Nor all the coopers in
creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."

"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that
you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.
Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is
going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him
overboard--tell me that?

"Give him a good ducking, anyhow."

"But he'd crawl back."

"Duck him again; and keep ducking him."

"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes,
and drown you--what then?"

"I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black
eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin
again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.
Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil?  Who's
afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put
him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about
kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the
people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him?  There's a governor!"

"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"

"Do I suppose it?  You'll know it before long, Flask.  But I am going
now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very
suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and
say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss,
by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to
the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail
will come short off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather
guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak
off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his
legs."

"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"

"Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"

"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,
Stubb?"

"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."

The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
securing him.

"Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right
whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's."

In good time, Flask's saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod
steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the
counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely
strained, you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in
Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist
in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus,
some minds for ever keep trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all
these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and
right.

In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately
removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone
attached to what is called the crown-piece.  But nothing like this,
in the present case, had been done.  The carcases of both whales had
dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule
carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his
own hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only
to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's.  As the crew toiled on,
Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these
passing things.



CHAPTER 74

The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
join them, and lay together our own.

Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales
regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two
extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external
difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we
may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance
to study practical cetology than here?

In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there
is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the
Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm
Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense
superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present
instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt
colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and
large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically
call a "grey-headed whale."

Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the
two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side
of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if
you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you
would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it
to the magnitude of the head.

Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the
whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,
for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey
objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only
command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight
side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your
bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted
in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he
were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two
backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,
but his eyes?

Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the
eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so
as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar
position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many
cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great
mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must
wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.
The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,
and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be
profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be
said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined
sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are
separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing
the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to
be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader
in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with
a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of
seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically
seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's
experience will teach him, that though he can take in an
undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite
impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two
things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant
of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.
But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each
by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,
in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will
be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,
then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of
time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of
him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then
is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
incongruity in this comparison.

It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve
them.

But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are
an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external
leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a
quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the
eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be
observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of
the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely
and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite
imperceptible from without.

Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
which is smaller than a hare's?  But if his eyes were broad as the
lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the
porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or
sharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge"
your mind?  Subtilize it.

Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,
cant over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up;
then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the
mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from
it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth
Cave of his stomach.  But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look
about us where we are.  What a really beautiful and chaste-looking
mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a
glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.

But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at
one end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up, so as to get it
overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific
portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the
fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.  But far
more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see
some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw,
some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles with
his body, for all the world like a ship's jib-boom.  This whale is
not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have
relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws
upon him.

In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised
artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard
white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious
articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to
riding-whips.

With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were
an anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the
other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
dentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a keen cutting-spade,
Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts,
and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as
Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands.  There
are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,
but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.  The jaw is
afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building
houses.



CHAPTER 75

The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
Whale's head.

As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather
inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred
years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of
the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny.

But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume
different aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on
its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take
the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the
apertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye
upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the
mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the
"crown," and the Southern fishers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale;
fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the
trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any
rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this
bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,
indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term "crown" also
bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the
sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this
marvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky
looking fellow to grace a diadem.  Look at that hanging lower lip!
what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's
measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and
pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.

A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a
slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.  Upon my word were I
at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.
Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about
twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were
a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,
present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats
of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the
upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds
which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these
bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale
strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding
time.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural
order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,
whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age, as the age of an
oak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is
far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
probability.  At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far
greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem
reasonable.

In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the
wondrous "whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "hogs'
bristles"; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following
elegant language: "There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing
on each side of his upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each
side of his mouth."


*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,
or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on
the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.  Sometimes these
tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.


As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"
"blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks
and other stiffening contrivances.  But in this particular, the
demand has long been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne's time
that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the
fashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the
jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the
like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for
protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.

But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh.  Seeing
all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you
not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing
upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of
the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the
floor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in
pieces in hoisting it on deck.  This particular tongue now before us;
at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it
will yield you about that amount of oil.

Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
different heads.  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no
great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are
there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
anything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external
spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.

Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the
other will not be very long in following.

Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there?  It is the
same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead
seem now faded away.  I think his broad brow to be full of a
prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to
death.  But mark the other head's expression.  See that amazing lower
lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, so as firmly to
embrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an
enormous practical resolution in facing death?  This Right Whale I
take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might
have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.



CHAPTER 76

The Battering-Ram.


Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have
you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its
front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you
investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power
may be lodged there.  Here is a vital point; for you must either
satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain
an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true
events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.

You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm
Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane
to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the
long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that
the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,
as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you
observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
has--his spout hole--is on the top of his head; you observe that his
eyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his
entire length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived
that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall,
without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.
Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower,
backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the
slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.  So that
this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.  Finally, though, as
will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate
oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance
which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.  In some
previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body
of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so with the head;
but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so
thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
handled it.  The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted
by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.  It is as
though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs.
I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.

Bethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large, loaded
Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the
docks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend between them, at
the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or
wood.  No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,
enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bravely and
uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken
handspikes and iron crow-bars.  By itself this sufficiently
illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,
it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of
distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,
has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise
inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether
beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the
water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;
considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically
occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs
there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected
connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric
distension and contraction.  If this be so, fancy the
irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
destructive of all elements contributes.

Now, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled
wood is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the
smallest insect.  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all
the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in
this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
eye-brow.  For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
sentimentalist in Truth.  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
then?  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's
veil at Lais?



CHAPTER 77

The Great Heidelburgh Tun.


Now comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright, you
must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing
operated upon.

Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the
lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the
upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end
forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.  At the
middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and
then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally
divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.


*Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.  A quoin is
a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by
the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of
both sides.


The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb
of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent.  The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the
great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as that famous great
tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited
forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical
adornment of his wondrous tun.  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was
always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the
Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most
precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized
spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
the creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate
ice is just forming in water.  A large whale's case generally yields
about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable
circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles
away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of
securing what you can.

I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
Whale's case.

It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and
since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third
of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at
eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six
feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and
down against a ship's side.

As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought
close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,
lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and
wastingly let out its invaluable contents.  It is this decapitated
end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water,
and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose
hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in
that quarter.

Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous
and--in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the
Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.



CHAPTER 78

Cistern and Buckets.


Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his
erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,
to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has
carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two
parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.  Securing this
block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of
the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck.
Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through
the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.
There--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he
vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good
people to prayers from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp
spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper
place to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds
very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding
the walls to find where the gold is masoned in.  By the time this
cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
three alert hands.  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of
the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the
word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all
bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.  Carefully lowered
from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed
hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.  Then remounting aloft,
it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
yield no more.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole
harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some
twenty feet of the pole have gone down.

Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at
once a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego, that
wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment
his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;
or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no
telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket
came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating
bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this
great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went
clean out of sight!

"Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation
first came to his senses.  "Swing the bucket this way!" and putting
one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold
on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the
head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.
Meantime, there was a terrible tumult.  Looking over the side, they
saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the
surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous
idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by
those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.

At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was
clearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting
tackles--a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable
horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore
out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till
the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one
remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed
every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more
likely from the violent motions of the head.

"Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one
hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should
drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the
foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well,
meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted
out.

"In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming home a
cartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him; jamming that
iron-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, will ye!"

"Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocket.

Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool;
the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her
glittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now
over the sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a
thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous
tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down
to the bottom of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared
away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for
one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.  The next, a loud
splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One
packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,
as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the
diver could be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside,
and pushed a little off from the ship.

"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging
perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm
thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm
thrust forth from the grass over a grave.

"Both! both!--it is both!"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;
and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,
and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into
the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego
was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.

Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after
the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;
then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and
upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that
upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well
knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great
trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and
toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next
trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the
great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.

And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward
and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to
be forgotten.  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with
fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.

I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an
accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of
the Sperm Whale's well.

But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?  We
thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the
lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink
in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.  We have
thee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash
fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,
leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double
welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than
the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But
the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present
instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head
remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing
his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a
running delivery, so it was.

Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.  Only one sweeter end can readily
be recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of
it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died
embalmed.  How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's
honey head, and sweetly perished there?



CHAPTER 79

The Prairie.


To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
as yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful
as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of
Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the
Dome of the Pantheon.  Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater
not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively
studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in
detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein.  Nor
have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints
touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.
Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the
application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my
endeavor.  I try all things; I achieve what I can.

Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.
He has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely
affect the countenance of the whale.  For as in landscape gardening,
a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost
indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be
physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of
the nose.  Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry
remainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all
his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it
is an added grandeur.  A nose to the whale would have been
impertinent.  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his
vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never
insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.  A
pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even
when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.

In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view
to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.
This aspect is sublime.

In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with
the morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the
bull has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up
mountain defiles, the elephant's brow is majestic.  Human or animal,
the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German
Emperors to their decrees.  It signifies--"God: done this day by my
hand."  But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the
brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise
so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,
eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's
wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to
drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in
that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more
forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.  For
you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;
no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing
but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;
dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Nor, in
profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its
grandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile, you plainly
perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.

But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale ever
written a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius is declared in
his doing nothing particular to prove it.  It is moreover declared in
his pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great
Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been
deified by their child-magian thoughts.  They deified the crocodile
of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale
has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be
incapable of protrusion.  If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical
nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods
of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;
in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat,
the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.

Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But there
is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man's and every
being's face.  Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a
passing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty
languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its
profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope
to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow?  I but put that
brow before you.  Read it if you can.



CHAPTER 80

The Nut.


If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
square.

In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty
feet in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this
skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting
throughout on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere
seen--this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared
by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the
high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while
under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom
exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth--reposes the
mere handful of this monster's brain.  The brain is at least twenty
feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its
vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified
fortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket is it secreted in
him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the
Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one
formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.  Lying in strange
folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems
more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.

It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,
in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.  As for
his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.
The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
common world.

If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and
from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull
(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,
and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the
depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you
would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by
those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his
prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,
though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted
potency is.

But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,
you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have
another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any
quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its
vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing
rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,
that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the
curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,
in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of
which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow
of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an
important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a
man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would
rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin
joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice
in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
fling half out to the world.

Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His
cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in
that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches
across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the
base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the
canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of
large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the
same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and
directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for
many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord
remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and
map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this
light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his
spinal cord.

But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to
the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises
over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,
the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I
should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness
in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you
will yet have reason to know.



CHAPTER 81

The Pequod Meets The Virgin.


The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.

At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the Pacific.

For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and
dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently
standing in the bows instead of the stern.

"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to
something wavingly held by the German.  "Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!"

"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;
he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see
that big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water.
Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."

"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."

However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on
the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the
old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a
thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer
did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is
technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well
deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.

His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,
that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he
slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.

Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
Pequod's keels.  There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of
their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight
before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of
horses in harness.  They left a great, wide wake, as though
continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.

Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.  Whether this
whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming
forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn
shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the
waters behind him to upbubble.

"Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm
afraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse
winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.  It's the first foul
wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw
so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."

As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then
partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his
devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.  Whether he
had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were
hard to say.

"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded
arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.

"Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck.  "Give way, or
the German will have him."

With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
for the time.  At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the
three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
Derick's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
foreign rivals.  The only thing they feared, was, that from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
before they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,
he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and
occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
other boats.

"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and
dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
ago!"--then in his old intense whisper--"Give way, greyhounds!  Dog
to it!"

"I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--"it's against
my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous
Yarman--Pull--won't ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do
ye love brandy?  A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come,
why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel?  Who's that been dropping
an anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed.  Halloo,
here's grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast
there's budding.  This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The
short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"

"Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What
a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads, DO
spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked
clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred barreller--don't
lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh,
won't ye pull for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!
Don't ye love sperm?  There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a
bank!--a whole bank!  The bank of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's
that Yarman about now?"

At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at
the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double
view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.

"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb.  "Pull now, men, like
fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.  What
d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in
two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead?  What d'ye say?"

"I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.

Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the
Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so
disposed, momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous
attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three
mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with
an exhilarating cry of, "There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the
white-ash breeze!  Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!"

But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had
not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught
the blade of his midship oarsman.  While this clumsy lubber was
striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's
boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a
mighty rage;--that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.
With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly
ranged up on the German's quarter.  An instant more, and all four
boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while
stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he
made.

It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was
now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically
sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating
fin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted
broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical
hawks.  But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make
known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was
chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking
respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him
unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis
jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man
who so pitied.

Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,
Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually
long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.

But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
three tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to
their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed
their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their
three Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapours of foam and
white-fire!  The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's
headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both
Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over
by the three flying keels.

"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--all
right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you
know--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail
now.  Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin
kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind of
fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--makes the
wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's
danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.  Hurrah!
this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones--all a
rush down an endless inclined plane!  Hurrah! this whale carries the
everlasting mail!"

But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he
tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew
round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in
them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding
would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,
they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the
blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while
the three sterns tilted high in the air.  And the whale soon ceasing
to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of
expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But
though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is
this "holding on," as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp
barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments
the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his
foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but
reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under
water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous
surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000
square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what
an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even
here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a
whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman
has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with
all their guns, and stores, and men on board.

As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its
depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that
silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing
and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were
visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin
threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an
eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.
Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--"Canst
thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,
nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make
him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of
a spear!"  This the creature? this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should
follow the prophets.  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in
his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,
to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!

In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his
head!

"Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines
suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to
them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,
so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,
relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the
boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a
dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.

"Haul in!  Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."

The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth
could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
ship's lengths of the hunters.

His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land
animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their
veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least
instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one
of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure
of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point
as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole
arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary
pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may
be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the
quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a
considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose
source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.
Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew
over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they
were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was
only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture
into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no
vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they
significantly call it, was untouched.

As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,
were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of
the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's
eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable
to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one
arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in
order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and
also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional
inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last
he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,
the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.

"A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."

"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"

But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with
swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their
glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat
and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,
so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from
the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped
with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a
waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a
log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As
when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying
spout of the whale.

Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at
different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By
very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was
transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the
stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially
upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.

It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the
spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in
his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as
the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of
captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no
prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must
needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully
to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was
the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from
the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted
that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'
West Indian long before America was discovered.

What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over
sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing
tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of
affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,
indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if
still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the
command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables
were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime
everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of
the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The
ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks
and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon
the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;
and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could
not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of
ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on
the point of going over.

"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in
such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do
something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your
handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and
cut the big chains."

"Knife?  Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy
hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began
slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of
sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.
With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,
the carcase sank.

Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert
that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the
fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in
him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and
swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm
flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.

Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,
twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt
imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the
Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a
ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there
are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,
the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the
reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to
a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A
line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore
Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right
Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look
for it when it shall have ascended again.

It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard
from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
its incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout
is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is
often mistaken for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host were
now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding
all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all
disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.



CHAPTER 82

The Honour and Glory of Whaling.


There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
true method.

The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches
up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with
its great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so
many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way
or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the
reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so
emblazoned a fraternity.

The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore
arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders.
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the
lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the
sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,
Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the
monster, and delivered and married the maid.  It was an admirable
artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the
present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
dart.  And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient
Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,
there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the
city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical
bones of the monster that Perseus slew.  When the Romans took Joppa,
the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.  What seems most
singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was
from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some
supposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of
St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a
whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely
jumbled together, and often stand for each other.  "Thou art as a
lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel;
hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible
use that word itself.  Besides, it would much subtract from the glory
of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of
the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.
Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a
Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.

Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is
depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the
great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was
unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus' case, St.
George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and
considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only
a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not
appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the
ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no
other than the great Leviathan himself.  In fact, placed before the
strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish,
flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being
planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms
of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
him remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a
whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we
harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of St. George.  And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a
whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with
disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.

Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.  It
nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless,
indeed, from the inside.  Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of
involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not
the whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.

But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still
more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;
certainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then, why
not the prophet?

Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the
whole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named; for
like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our
fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.  That
wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,
which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the
godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our
Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,
has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.  When Brahma, or the
God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after
one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to
preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost
depths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman,
then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?

Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a
member-roll for you!  What club but the whaleman's can head off like
that?



CHAPTER 83

Jonah Historically Regarded.


Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
the preceding chapter.  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
historical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some
sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox
pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the
whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those
traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for
all that.

One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which
represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity
only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right
Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the
fishermen have this saying, "A penny roll would choke him"; his
swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative
answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we
consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily
lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough
in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would
accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a
hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.

Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely
in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.
But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German
exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating
body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian
campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.
Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that
when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway
effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a
whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called "The
Whale," as some craft are nowadays christened the "Shark," the
"Gull," the "Eagle."  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists
who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely
meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered
prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.  Poor
Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.  But he had still
another reason for his want of faith.  It was this, if I remember
right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and
after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'
journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three
days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean
coast.  How is that?

But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
that short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him
round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak of the
passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another
passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would
involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days,
not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being
too shallow for any whale to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah's
weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the
honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,
its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.

But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,
seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up
from the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious
pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend
clergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of
Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a
signal magnification of the general miracle.  And so it was.
Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe
in the historical story of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an
English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque
built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that
burnt without any oil.



CHAPTER 84

Pitchpoling.


To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.  Nor is
it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may
possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and
water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object
in view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed
strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the
German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in
that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the
side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to
insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.  He seemed to be
working in obedience to some particular presentiment.  Nor did it
remain unwarranted by the event.

Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down
to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.

Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost.  By great
exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his
horizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted
strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably
extract it.  It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be
content to lose him.  But to haul the boat up to his flank was
impossible, he swam so fast and furious.  What then remained?

Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often
forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called
pitchpoling.  Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises
boasts nothing like it.  It is only indispensable with an inveterate
running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance
to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently
rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.  Steel and wood
included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the
staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
lighter material--pine.  It is furnished with a small rope called a
warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the
hand after darting.

But before going further, it is important to mention here, that
though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,
yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently
successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of
the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become
serious drawbacks.  As a general thing, therefore, you must first
get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.

Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness
and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to
excel in pitchpoling.  Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed
bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is
forty feet ahead.  Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or
thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb
whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to
secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.
Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels
it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses
the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon
stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.  He
minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.
Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the
bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot
of the whale.  Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

"That drove the spigot out of him!" cried Stubb.  "'Tis July's
immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!  Would now, it
were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old
Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the
jet, and we'd drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew
choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that
live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff."

Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is
repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in
skilful leash.  The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line
is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,
and mutely watches the monster die.



CHAPTER 85

The Fountain.


That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of
ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the
sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with
so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries
back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of
the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this
should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a
quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of
December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these
spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is
surely a noteworthy thing.

Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or
a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by
inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the
necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he
cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary
attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet
beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle
alone; and this is on the top of his head.

If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with
the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not
think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous
scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in
a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his
nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to
say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,
this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,
by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without
drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle
of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his
ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,
when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated
blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel
crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for
future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact
of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded
upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I
consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in
HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I
mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale
will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his
other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets
seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he
rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,
to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good
his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are
told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.
Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are
different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale
thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,
too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all
the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could
this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms
beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the
great necessities that strike the victory to thee!

In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving
for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has
to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his
time.

It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be
water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be
arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm
Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No
roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.

Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his
spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is
furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the
whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so
strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what
has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that
had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out
something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is
such an excellent listener!

Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a
little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe
laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question
returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,
whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled
breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in
at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain
that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but
it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing
would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.
But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he
cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very
closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when
unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his
jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.

But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak
out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can
you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so
easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain
things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might
almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.

The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist
enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls
from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a
close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water
cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that
you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know
that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know
that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the
spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the
whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day
sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in
the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of
water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a
cavity in a rock filled up with rain.

Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching
the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be
peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your
pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even
when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the
jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from
the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who
coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some
scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin
peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the
spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I
have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is
fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing
the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly
spout alone.

Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides
other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an
undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;
all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound
beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,
there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act
of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on
Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere
long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation
in the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,
while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument
for the above supposition.

And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,
mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his
incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes
see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal
upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear
air; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists
of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,
enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for
all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with
them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions
of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor
infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.



CHAPTER 86

The Tail.


Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less
celestial, I celebrate a tail.

Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point
of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it
comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty
square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two
broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less
than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes
slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,
leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of
beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of
these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the
tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.

The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,
middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much
as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old
Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the
thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those
wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so
much to the great strength of the masonry.

But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not
enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and
woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side
the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with
them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the
confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to
a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to
do it.

Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease
undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those
motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength
never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in
everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the
magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from
the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As
devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of
Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that
seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the
Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of
all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,
feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is
conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.

Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.

Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for
progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in
sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.

First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It
never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.
To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise
coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,
it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the
monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer
by.

Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in
his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.
In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and
the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the
unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is
then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.
Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways
through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy
of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked
rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so
often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's
play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.

Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary
touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway
bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the
flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to
damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a
pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in
his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.

Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of
the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast
corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as
if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The
broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting
the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would
almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the
light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you
would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.

Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the
flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then
completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to
plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of
his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a
moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime
BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's
flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated
nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems
spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I
seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from
the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in
all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to
you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head
of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a
large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and
for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed
to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods
was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then
testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of
antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence.

The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but
the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk
were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush
and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated
instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses
his balls.*


*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
curious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that
the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.


The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
inability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,
though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared
them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by
these methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there
wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of
strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.
Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,
and never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he
has none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,
but my face shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his
back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has
no face.



CHAPTER 87

The Grand Armada.


The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward
from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all
Asia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long
islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,
form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with
Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the
thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by
several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;
conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the
straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,
emerge into the China seas.

Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little
correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled
empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and
silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand
islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant
provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of
the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,
of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores of
the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses
which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the
Propontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day,
have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with
the costliest cargoes of the east.  But while they freely waive a
ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to
more solid tribute.

Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at
the point of their spears.  Though by the repeated bloody
chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,
the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;
yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and
American vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly
boarded and pillaged.

With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine
Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great
whaling season there.  By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod
would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the
world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where
Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted
upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to
frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed
to be haunting it.

But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
crew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a long
time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring,
and needs no sustenance but what's in himself.  So Ahab.  Mark this,
too, in the whaler.  While other hulls are loaded down with alien
stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering
whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and
their wants.  She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample
hold.  She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable
pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years' water in her.  Clear old
prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the
Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
streams.  Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China
from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the
whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of
soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves.  So that did you carry them the news that another flood
had come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"

Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most
of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen
as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained
more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,
and admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the green palmy cliffs
of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted
nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single
jet was descried.  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with
any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when
the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a
spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.

But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in
extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it
would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn
league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To this
aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be
imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you
may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being
greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
sometimes seems thousands on thousands.

Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,
a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
noon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the
Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like
the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting
spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,
continually rising and falling away to leeward.

Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill
of the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into
the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,
showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,
descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.

As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage
in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying
forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic
centre.

Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boats.  If the wind only held, little doubt had they,
that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only
deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of
their number.  And who could tell whether, in that congregated
caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like
the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the
Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,
driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of
Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our
wake.

Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
rear.  It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling
something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
disappearing.  Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly
revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and
buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"

As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the
swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;
how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding
her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to
her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced
the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and
in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such
fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green
walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and
bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,
and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing
and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of
remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were
infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these
conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and
ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been
gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.

But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the
wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;
gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was
passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some
presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their
rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of
stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.

Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave
animating token that they were now at last under the influence of
that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the
fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The
compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and
steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and
like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in
vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by
their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction
of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their
number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like
water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been
but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce
wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding
creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the
lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary
horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together
in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest
alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.
Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied
whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth
which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.

Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced
nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is
customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making
for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about
three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish
darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like
light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a
movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is
in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less
anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you
deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to
circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.

As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power
of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;
as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we
flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset
boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving
to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at
what moment it may be locked in and crushed.

But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging
away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while
all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking
out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for
there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite
idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  "Out of
the way, Commodore!" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden
rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp
us.  "Hard down with your tail, there!" cried a second to another,
which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his
own fan-like extremity.

All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally
invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares
of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they
cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable
length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other
end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a
harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.
For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly
chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;
while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot
kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like
these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with
three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we
saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous
sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like
malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in
the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under
one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and
carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the
seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the
wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,
and so stopped the leaks for the time.

It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were
it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly
diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing
whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of
the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the
outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse
the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,
produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more
quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say
lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted
distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and
saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going
round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so
closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might
easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on
their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,
more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch
for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had
only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of
the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;
the women and children of this routed host.

Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods
in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,
embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or
three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a
time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low
boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I
mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had
been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide
extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the
precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,
unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it
may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our
becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous
fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it
was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came
snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till
it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.
Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with
his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained
from darting it.

But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and
still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,
suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing
mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed
shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a
considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants
while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as
if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing
mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly
reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up
towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in
their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also
seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from
certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured
some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a
little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,
the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate
side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from
foreign parts.

"Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast!
him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one
little!"

"What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.

"Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.

As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical
cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still
tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the
chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes
entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in
this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*


*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing
but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to
an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two
teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the
breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these
precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the
mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for
rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it
might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual
esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.


And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely
and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely
revelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed
Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in
mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round
me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal
mildness of joy.

Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the
sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to
and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly
powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by
sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting
a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for
hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in
this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from
the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in
the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.

But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he
seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at
first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we
perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,
this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he
had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free
end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in
the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade
itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to
madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing
with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
wounding and murdering his own comrades.

This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly
to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries
vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more
central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long
calm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then
like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river
Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling
upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common
mountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
taking the stern.

"Oars!  Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe your
oars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!  Shove him
off, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand
up--stand up, and stay so!  Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their
backs--scrape them!--scrape away!"

The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving
a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.  But by desperate
endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided
into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by
random whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky
salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,
while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat
taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing
of a pair of broad flukes close by.

Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;
but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which
Flask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or
three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional
game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a
dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of
prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.

The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that
sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.  Of
all the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to
escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,
by some other craft than the Pequod.



CHAPTER 88

Schools and Schoolmasters.


The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing
those vast aggregations.

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals
each.  Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two
sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering
none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly
designated.

In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see
a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,
evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight
of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,
swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by
all the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between
this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is
always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at
full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an
average-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare
say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless,
it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily
entitled to EMBONPOINT.

It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
leisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the Line in time for
the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just
returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and
so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the
time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator
awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the
cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of
the year.

When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
him away!  High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him
are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though
do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario
out of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common.  As ashore, the
ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival
admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly
battle, and all for love.  They fence with their long lower jaws,
sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.  Not a few are
captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed heads,
broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and
dislocated mouths.

But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to
watch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again
and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young
Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand
concubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen
will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand
Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness
is small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons
and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the
maternal help.  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that
might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however
much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his
anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.  In good
time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and
virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the
impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands
the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all
alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and
warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.

Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster.  It is therefore not in strict character, however
admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should
then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly
of it.  His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived
from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised
that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must
have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,
and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into
some of his pupils.

The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
Whales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is
called--proves an ancient one.  Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel
Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he
takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she
is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.

The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.  For while
those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal
gout.

The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.
Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and
wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking
rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he
would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon relinquish this
turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and
separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.

Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike a
Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.  But strike
a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long,
as themselves to fall a prey.



CHAPTER 89

Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.


The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in
company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be
finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are
indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this
one grand feature.  For example,--after a weary and perilous chase
and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by
reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be
retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside,
without risk of life or line.  Thus the most vexatious and violent
disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some
written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
cases.

Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment, was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General
in A.D. 1695.  But though no other nation has ever had any written
whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own
legislators and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system
which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and
the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling
with other People's Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven on a
Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the
neck, so small are they.

I.  A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.

II.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it.

First: What is a Fast-Fish?  Alive or dead a fish is technically
fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any
medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an
oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it
is all the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a
waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the
party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it
alongside, as well as their intention so to do.

These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the
whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder
knocks--the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more
upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for
peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for
one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed
by another party.  But others are by no means so scrupulous.

Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover
litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a
hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the
plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,
through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their
lines, but their boat itself.  Ultimately the defendants (the crew of
another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and
finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And
when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped
his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of
doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,
harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the
time of the seizure.  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the
recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.

Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
judge.  In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action
to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he
then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever
harpoon might have been found sticking in her.

Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.

These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the
very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the
boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely
abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the
controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the
defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the
final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made
off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;
and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid
articles were theirs.

A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,
might possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of
the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling
laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord
Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the
fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its
complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the
Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.

Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the
law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?  But
often possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews and
souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof
possession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious landlord
is the widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish?  What is yonder undetected
villain's marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that
but a Fast-Fish?  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the
broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to
keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous
discount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's
income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
Fast-Fish?  What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and
hamlets but Fast-Fish?  What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull,
is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish?  What to that apostolic lancer,
Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  And concerning all
these, is not Possession the whole of the law?

But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.  That is
internationally and universally applicable.

What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck
the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
mistress?  What was Poland to the Czar?  What Greece to the Turk?
What India to England?  What at last will Mexico be to the United
States?  All Loose-Fish.

What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
Loose-Fish?  What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish?  What
is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?  What
to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers
but Loose-Fish?  What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish?
And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?



CHAPTER 90

Heads or Tails.


"De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam."
BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.


Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with
the context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the
coast of that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have
the head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail.  A
division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is
no intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,
is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various
respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and
Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same
courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the
expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation
of royalty.  In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that
the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before
you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.

It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off
from the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under
the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord
Warden.  Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all
the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become
by assignment his.  By some writers this office is called a sinecure.
But not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in
fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same
fobbing of them.

Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the
precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
laying it upon the whale's head, he says--"Hands off! this fish, my
masters, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden's."  Upon
this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly
English--knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
stranger.  But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften
the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.
At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,
made bold to speak,

"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"

"The Duke."

"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"

"It is his."

"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is
all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for
our pains but our blisters?"

"It is his."

"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
getting a livelihood?"

"It is his."

"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
this whale."

"It is his."

"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"

"It is his."

In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
Wellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some
particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small
degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an
honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his
Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners
into full consideration.  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied
(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and
received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if
for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling
with other people's business.  Is this the still militant old man,
standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing
alms of beggars?

It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must
needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally
invested with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.
But Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so
caught belongs to the King and Queen, "because of its superior
excellence."  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been
held a cogent argument in such matters.

But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?  A
reason for that, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's
Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: "Ye tail is ye
Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone."
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the
Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.  But
this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad
mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.  But is the Queen a
mermaid, to be presented with a tail?  An allegorical meaning may
lurk here.

There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the
whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain
limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's
ordinary revenue.  I know not that any other author has hinted of the
matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be
divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly
dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically
regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed
congeniality.  And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in
law.



CHAPTER 91

The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.


"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this
Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry."
SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.


It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the
many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft.  A peculiar and not very pleasant
smell was smelt in the sea.

"I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts
are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.  I thought
they would keel up before long."

Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the
distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of
whale must be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed
French colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture
sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was
plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a
blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,
and so floated an unappropriated corpse.  It may well be conceived,
what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian
city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the
departed.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no
cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there
those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil
obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no
means of the nature of attar-of-rose.

Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the
Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed
even more of a nosegay than the first.  In truth, it turned out to be
one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a
sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct
bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,
in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever
turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun
blasted whales in general.

The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales.

"There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed, standing in
the ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye!  I well know that these
Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes
lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale
spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold
full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing
that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's
wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a
Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I
mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that
other precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a
hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear
charity's sake.  For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale
there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned
cell.  And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by
chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll get
from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may
contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I
wonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It's worth trying.
Yes, I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.

By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that
whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with
no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from
the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the
stranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance
with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was
carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,
and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;
the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red
colour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read "Bouton
de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name
of this aromatic ship.

Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,
yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
sufficiently explained the whole to him.

"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that
will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"

Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.

Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses
that speak English?"

"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to
be the chief-mate.

"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"

"WHAT whale?"

"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?

"Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no."

"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."

Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
hands into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir!  No!"  Upon which Ahab
retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.

He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort
of bag.

"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb.  "Broke it?"

"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!"
answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was
at very much.  "But what are you holding YOURS for?"

"Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,
ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of
posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"

"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman,
flying into a sudden passion.

"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those
whales in ice while you're working at 'em?  But joking aside, though;
do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil
out of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a
gill in his whole carcase."

"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't
believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer
before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't
me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."

"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined
Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer
scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red
worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in
anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from
their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would
drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.
Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,
and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the
stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their
olfactories.

Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding
from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction
saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar
from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the
pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
indignations at times.

Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to
the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the
stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited
ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable
a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the
Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the
ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise
was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly
concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the
Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.
According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under
cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he
pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter
any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.

By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a
small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,
with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton
velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb
was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once
ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.

"What shall I say to him first?" said he.

"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,
"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish
to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."

"He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from
a blasted whale they had brought alongside."

Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.

"What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.

"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a
baboon."

"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he
conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."

Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.

"What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
them.

"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in
fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps
somebody else."

"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service
to us."

Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down
into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.

"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the
interpreter.

"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go."

"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;
but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then
Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from
these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift."

By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,
hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line
in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out
the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the
Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,
Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,
ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.

Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the
whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,
while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon
Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to
give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of
his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced
an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would
almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and
when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like
turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.
His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their
chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.

And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was
beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay
increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,
there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide
of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow
into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for
a time.

"I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
in the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"

Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it
with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And
this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured
were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and
come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.



CHAPTER 92

Ambergris.


Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on
that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively
late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber
itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but
the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite
distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also
dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found
except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,
odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and
spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious
candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and
also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is
carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few
grains into claret, to flavor it.

Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How
to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out
of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.

I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might
be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they
were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that
manner.

Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of
that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and
incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.
And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is
that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of
all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental
manufacturing stages, is the worst.

I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the
slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling
is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another
thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how
did this odious stigma originate?

I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.
Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their
oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the
fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of
large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the
season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which
they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,
that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale
cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat
similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for
the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.

I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in
former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,
which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in
his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name
imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in
order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to
be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.
It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when
the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very
pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea
Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after
completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume
fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it
is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or
dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people
of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the
nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking
abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,
seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's
flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady
rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the
Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not
be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with
myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander
the Great?



CHAPTER 93

The Castaway.


It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a
most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's
crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the
sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever
accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her
own.

Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.  As a
general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men
comprising the boats' crews.  But if there happen to be an unduly
slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain
to be made a ship-keeper.  It was so in the Pequod with the little
negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye have
heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic
midnight, so gloomy-jolly.

In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony
and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour,
driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by
nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over
tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,
genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever
enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any
other race.  For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but
three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.
Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for
even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,
panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's
peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he
had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred
his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus
temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly
illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to
ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County
in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the
green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the
round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the
clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the
sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery
effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once
the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.

It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.

The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb
observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his
courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.

Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack
whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with
him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the
water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the
line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up
to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,
which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.

Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He
hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less
than half a minute, this entire thing happened.

"Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
saved.

So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,
business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;
and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The
substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest
was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,
STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will
sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,
as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted
conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,
and concluded with a peremptory command, "Stick to the boat, Pip, or
by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't
afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and
don't jump any more."  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that
though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which
propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.

But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It
was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but
this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale
started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried
traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It
was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and
cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like
gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and
down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No
boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's
inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In
three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and
Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,
curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the
loftiest and the brightest.

Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the
awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self
in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?
Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark
how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.

But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?
No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in
his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come
up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such
considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own
timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar
instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost
invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the
same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.

But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;
such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his
finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned
entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,
where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro
before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile
eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral
insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal
orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;
and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity is
heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at
last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as
his God.

For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common in
that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be
seen what like abandonment befell myself.



CHAPTER 94

A Squeeze of the Hand.


That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling
of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.

While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;
and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully
manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.

It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I
found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
in the liquid part.  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
into fluid.  A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times
this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such a
sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier!  After
having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like
eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.

As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven
almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and
discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as
I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like
the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I
lived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in
that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I
almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is
of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that
bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or
malice, of any sort whatsoever.

Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that
sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till
a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself
unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their
hands for the gentle globules.  Such an abounding, affectionate,
friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was
continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes
sentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why
should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest
ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us
all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves
universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.

Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!  For now,
since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that
in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his
conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the
intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the
table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have
perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In
thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in
paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.

Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
try-works.

First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the
tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his
flukes.  It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but
still contains some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the
white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the
mincer.  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.

Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of
the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,
and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.
It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.  As
its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a
bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest
crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.
Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.  I
confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.  It tasted
something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis
le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the
first day after the venison season, and that particular venison
season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards
of Champagne.

There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up
in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very
puzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion; an
appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of
the substance.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most
frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,
and subsequent decanting.  I hold it to be the wondrously thin,
ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.

Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.  It designates
the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.

Nippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's
vocabulary.  But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman's
nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for
the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.  Edgewise
moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and
by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all
impurities.

But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
inmates.  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle
for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.  When
the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment
is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,
lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.
They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.
The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the
same name.  The gaff is something like a boat-hook.  With his gaff,
the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it
from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the
spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it
into the portable horse-pieces.  This spade is sharp as hone can make
it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will
sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he
cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be
very much astonished?  Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room
men.



CHAPTER 95

The Cassock.


Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have
seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.  Not the
wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his
unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of
these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable
cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at
the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an
idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.
Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in
Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,
and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook
Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of
Kings.

Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the
mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as
if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.
Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically
to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.
This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives
it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at
last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.  Ere long, it is
taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed
extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,
he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands
before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.
Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately
protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.

That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub
beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets
from a rapt orator's desk.  Arrayed in decent black; occupying a
conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an
archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*


*Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry from the
mates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work
into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business
of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity
considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.



CHAPTER 96

The Try-Works.


Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
distinguished by her try-works.  She presents the curious anomaly of
the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
completed ship.  It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
transported to her planks.

The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the
most roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar
strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of
brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height.
The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides, and screwing it down to the timbers.  On the flanks it is
cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping,
battened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,
two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity.  When not in
use, they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished
with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
punch-bowls.  During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will
crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.  While
employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--many
confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.  It
is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.  It was in the
left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently
circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the
remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the
cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in
precisely the same time.

Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.  These mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow
reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works.
By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished
with water as fast as it evaporates.  There are no external chimneys;
they open direct from the rear wall.  And here let us go back for a
moment.

It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were
first started on this present voyage.  It belonged to Stubb to
oversee the business.

"All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook, fire
the works."  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been
thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.  Here
be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has
to be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood is used, except
as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.  In a word, after
being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or
fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.
These fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or
a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his
own fuel and burns by his own body.  Would that he consumed his own
smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must,
and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.  It has an
unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the
vicinity of funereal pyres.  It smells like the left wing of the day
of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.

By midnight the works were in full operation.  We were clear from the
carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
darkness was intense.  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
fire.  The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with
broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates,
and folded them in conflagrations.

The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
hearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes
of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers.  With huge
pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the
scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames
darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.  The
smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship there
was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap
into their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further
side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.  This served for a
sea-sofa.  Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched
in their heads.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke
and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric
brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the
capricious emblazonings of the works.  As they narrated to each other
their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of
mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like
the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the
harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and
dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship
groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and
further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac
commander's soul.

So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours
silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.  Wrapped, for
that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,
the madness, the ghastliness of others.  The continual sight of the
fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,
these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to
yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me
at a midnight helm.

But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since
inexplicable) thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing
sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.  The
jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears
was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I
thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers
to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.
But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by;
though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by
the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.  Nothing seemed before me
but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.
Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I
stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
havens astern.  A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over
me.  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy
conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
inverted.  My God! what is the matter with me? thought I.  Lo! in my
brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's
stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I
faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into
the wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful
the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the
fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!

Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream with
thy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the
first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire,
when its redness makes all things look ghastly.  To-morrow, in the
natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils
in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least
gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true
lamp--all others but liars!

Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,
which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
earth.  So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than
sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or
undeveloped.  With books the same.  The truest of all men was the Man
of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and
Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.  "All is vanity."
ALL.  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's
wisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast
crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;
calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;
and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing
wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit down on
tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous Solomon.

But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of the way of
understanding shall remain" (I.E., even while living) "in the
congregation of the dead."  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest
it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.  There is a
wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.  And there is
a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the
blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in
the sunny spaces.  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,
that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the
mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even
though they soar.



CHAPTER 97

The Lamp.


Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's
forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they
lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled
muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.

In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.  But the whaleman, as
he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.  He makes his berth
an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest
night the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.

See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler
at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a
vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,
therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or
astral contrivances ashore.  It is sweet as early grass butter in
April.  He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its
freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts
up his own supper of game.



CHAPTER 98

Stowing Down and Clearing Up.


Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through
the fire;--but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this
part of the description by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the
romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and
striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns
to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.

While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and
rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are
slewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously
scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at
last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,
rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX
OFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.

At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.  This done, the
hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled
up.

In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
incidents in all the business of whaling.  One day the planks stream
with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
masses of the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has
besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with
unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on
all hands the din is deafening.

But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in
this self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and
try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant
vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.  The unmanufactured
sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.  This is the
reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call
an affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of
the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any
adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side,
that lye quickly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the
bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their
full tidiness.  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the
numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully
cleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon
the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of
sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the
combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's
company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,
then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift
themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck,
fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest
Holland.

Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object
not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.  To
hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were
little short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly
allude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!

But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men
intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will
again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small
grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when, after the
severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing
straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they
have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only
step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass,
and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and
burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the
equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have
finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless
dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning
the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of "There
she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through
the whole weary thing again.  Oh! my friends, but this is
man-killing!  Yet this is life.  For hardly have we mortals by long
toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but
valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves
from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles
of the soul; hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost
is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go
through young life's old routine again.

Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,
taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!



CHAPTER 99

The Doubloon.


Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his
quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and
mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration
it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most
plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and
stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.  When
he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the
pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with
the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he
again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance
fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same
aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,
if not hopefulness.

But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.  And
some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are
little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except
to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up
some morass in the Milky Way.

Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden
sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.  And though now
nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of
copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it
still preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed amongst a
ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through
the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover
any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon
where the sunset left it last.  For it was set apart and sanctified
to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one
and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering
whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend
it.

Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the
sun and tropic token-pieces.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;
sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners
waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold
seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,
by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.

It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
example of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,
REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a
country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great
equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the
Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those
letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a
flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching
over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all
marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering
the equinoctial point at Libra.

Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing.

"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as
Lucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab;
the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is
Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the
rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man
in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains, small
gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve
itself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!
aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months
before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!  From storm to
storm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes, 't is fit that man should
live in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, then!  Here's stout stuff
for woe to work on.  So be it, then."

"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have
left their mouldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbuck to
himself, leaning against the bulwarks.  "The old man seems to read
Belshazzar's awful writing.  I have never marked the coin
inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between
three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in
some faint earthly symbol.  So in this vale of Death, God girds us
round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines
a beacon and a hope.  If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows
her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance
half way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at
midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze
for him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
sadly to me.  I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."

"There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,
"he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and
both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine
fathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I
have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it
very long ere spending it.  Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,
I regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before now in my
voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your
doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of
Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and
half joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be in this
doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?  By Golconda!
let me read it once.  Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly!  That,
now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what
my almanac below calls ditto.  I'll get the almanac and as I have
heard devils can be raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand
at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
Massachusetts calendar.  Here's the book.  Let's see now.  Signs and
wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here
they are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the
Bull and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun
he wheels among 'em.  Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the
threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.  Book!
you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.  You'll
do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
thoughts.  That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go.
Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs,
and significant in wonders!  There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit;
hist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac
here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it
off, straight out of the book.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: there's
Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the
Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--that
is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer
the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a
roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly
dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our
first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while
we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,
or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when
whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is
amusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's
the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes
rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the
Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind
up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.  There's a sermon now, writ
in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes
out of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, aloft there, wheels
through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh,
jolly's the word for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes
little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let's hear what
he'll have to say.  There; he's before it; he'll out with something
presently.  So, so; he's beginning."

"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever
raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what's
all this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that's
true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty
cigars.  I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and
here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to
spy 'em out."

"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has
a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a
sort of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old
Manxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he
took to the sea.  He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes
round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed
on that side; and now he's back again; what does that mean?  Hark!
he's muttering--voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick ears,
and listen!"

"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some one of these signs.  I've studied signs, and
know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old
witch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?  The
horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.  And
what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the
roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to
think of thee."

"There's another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men
in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all
tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the
Cannibal?  As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back
country.  And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of
his thigh--I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don't
know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off
some king's trowsers.  But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,
Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his
pumps as usual.  What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only
makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the
coin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way
comes Pip--poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to
me.  He too has been watching all of these interpreters--myself
included--and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
face.  Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!"

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his
mind, poor fellow!  But what's that he says now--hist!"

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again."

"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."

"Well, that's funny."

"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I'm a
crow, especially when I stand a'top of this pine tree here.  Caw!
caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?  And where's the
scare-crow?  There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old
trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket."

"Wonder if he means me?--complimentary!--poor lad!--I could go hang
myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.  I can
stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty
for my sanity.  So, so, I leave him muttering."

"Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on
fire to unscrew it.  But, unscrew your navel, and what's the
consequence?  Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for
when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow
desperate.  Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This
is a pine tree.  My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine
tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old
darkey's wedding ring.  How did it get there?  And so they'll say in
the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a
doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh,
the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser'll hoard ye
soon!  Hish! hish!  God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying.  Cook!
ho, cook! and cook us!  Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny!
and get your hoe-cake done!"



CHAPTER 100

Leg and Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.


"Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?"

So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
bearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed
to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own
boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,
fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious
roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and
one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered
arm of a hussar's surcoat.

"Hast seen the White Whale!"

"See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden
it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a
wooden head like a mallet.

"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars
near him--"Stand by to lower!"

In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the
excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of
his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but
his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy
mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be
rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,
it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost
hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a
boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up
towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down
to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of
course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab
now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;
hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope
to attain.

It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.
And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of
the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him
a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not
seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a
cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only
lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance
how affairs stood, cried out, "I see, I see!--avast heaving there!
Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle."

As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or
two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the
end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it
all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like
sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),
and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time
also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon
one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung
inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain
advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory
arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, "Aye,
aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm
that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where
did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"

"The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm
towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had
been a telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."

"And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from
the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.

"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"

"Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"

"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,"
began the Englishman.  "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that
time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and
my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,
that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could
only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great
whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and
wrinkles."

"It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his
suspended breath.

"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."

"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons," cried Ahab, exultingly--"but
on!"

"Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly.
"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs
all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my
fast-line!

"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I
know him."

"How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not
know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards
pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of
the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing
how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest
and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,
spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the
hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to
might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a
whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's
boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;
Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's
boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and
snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next
instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged
and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up
out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use
sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second
iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,
cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes
first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all
chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I
seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment
clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,
and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,
went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron
towing along near me caught me here" (clapping his hand just below
his shoulder); "yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the
good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the
whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I
floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the
way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the
captain).  Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."

The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but
sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention
between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in
the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs
of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of
him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his
captain's bidding.

"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking
my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--"

"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."

"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
hot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;
sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of
diet--"

"Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
altering his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,
till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,
half seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.  Oh, ye stars! he
sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.  Oh! a great
watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you
dog, laugh out! why don't ye?  You know you're a precious jolly
rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept
alive by any other man."

"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"--said
the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--"is
apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that
sort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that
I myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend
clergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink--"

"Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits
to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on
with the arm story."

"Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly.  "I was about
observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that
spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse
and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon
ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it
with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was
threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that
ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"--pointing at it with
the marlingspike--"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered
the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the
end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this
dent, sir"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and
exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the
slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a
wound--"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;
he knows."

"No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born
with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such
another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought
to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,
you rascal."

"What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had
been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two
Englishmen.

"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,
we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard
about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."

"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"

"Twice."

"But could not fasten?"

"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do
without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so
much as he swallows."

"Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for bait to
get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely and
mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do you know,
gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably
constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him
to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that
what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.
For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to
terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,
formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow
jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,
and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an
emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible
way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into
his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick
enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the
privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case
the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you
shortly, that's all."

"No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to
the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but
not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for
him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in
killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm
in him, but, hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so,
Captain?"--glancing at the ivory leg.

"He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best let
alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.  He's
all a magnet!  How long since thou saw'st him last?  Which way
heading?"

"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, stoopingly
walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; "this man's
blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--his pulse
makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a lancet from his pocket, and
drawing near to Ahab's arm.

"Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the
boat!  Which way heading?"

"Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
"What's the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain
crazy?" whispering Fedallah.

But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.

In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
were springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed
him.  With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to
his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.



CHAPTER 101

The Decanter.


Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes
not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in
point of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year of
our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted
out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm
Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our
valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large
fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South
Atlantic: not elsewhere.  Be it distinctly recorded here, that the
Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized
steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were
the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.

In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of
any sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful and lucky
one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious
sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English
and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific
were thrown open.  But not content with this good deed, the
indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his
Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate
auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
voyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval
Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some
service; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.  In 1819,
the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go
on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--well
called the "Syren"--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus
that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
Nantucketer.

All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists
to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long
ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other
world.

The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
forecastle.  It was a fine gam we had, and they were all
trumps--every soul on board.  A short life to them, and a jolly
death.  And that fine gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab
touched her planks with his ivory heel--it minds me of the noble,
solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,
and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I
say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons
the hour; and when the squall came (for it's squally off there by
Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were called to reef
topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft
in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into
the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a
warning example to all drunken tars.  However, the masts did not go
overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to
pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the
forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
taste.

The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.  They said it was
bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
certain, how that was.  They had dumplings too; small, but
substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I
fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after
they were swallowed.  If you stooped over too far forward, you risked
their pitching out of you like billiard-balls.  The bread--but that
couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the
bread contained the only fresh fare they had.  But the forecastle was
not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner
when you ate it.  But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,
considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own
live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a
jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack
fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.

But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,
hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the
can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,
and laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good cheer of these
English whalers is matter for historical research.  Nor have I been
at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed
needed.

The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
touching plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a general thing, the
English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English
whaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is
not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,
therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out,
and will be still further elucidated.

During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
must be about whalers.  The title was, "Dan Coopman," wherefore I
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.  I
was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production
of one "Fitz Swackhammer."  But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very
learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of
Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for
translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this
same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that "Dan
Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper," but "The Merchant."  In short,
this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of
Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting
account of its whale fishery.  And in this chapter it was, headed,
"Smeer," or "Fat," that I found a long detailed list of the outfits
for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which
list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:

400,000 lbs. of beef.
60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.
150,000 lbs. of stock fish.
550,000 lbs. of biscuit.
72,000 lbs. of soft bread.
2,800 firkins of butter.
20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.
144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).
550 ankers of Geneva.
10,800 barrels of beer.

Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.

At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and
Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary
tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,
consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and
Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,
and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,
though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still
more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by
their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very
coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge
each other in bumpers of train oil.

The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.  Now,
as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer
of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch
whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,
did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each
of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all;
therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for
a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that
550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so
fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of
men to stand up in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales;
this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and
hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where
beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our
southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at
the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to
Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.  For, say they,
when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of
the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.  And this empties
the decanter.



CHAPTER 102

A Bower in the Arsacides.


Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have
chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and
in detail upon some few interior structural features.  But to a large
and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to
unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,
unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of
the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his
ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.

But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver
lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass,
hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael.
Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a
cook dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veritable witness have you
hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege
of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and
beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making
up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.

I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been
blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.  In a ship I
belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the
deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the
harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.  Think you I let that
chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking
the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?

And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am
indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of
the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the
trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the
Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm
villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our
sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.

Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being
gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had
brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious
of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful
devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic
canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with
his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted
droopings seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last
been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become
dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up
the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered
it.

The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with
Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the
priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic
head again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a
bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like
the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.

It was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy
Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous
carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
woof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all
their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the
lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one
word!--whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore
all these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but
one single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float
from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides
away.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,
that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look
on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear
the thousand voices that speak through it.  For even so it is in all
material factories.  The spoken words that are inaudible among the
flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the
walls, bursting from the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies
been detected.  Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din
of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard
afar.

Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!
Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all
woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher
verdure; but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised
Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him
curly-headed glories.

Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw
the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the
real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel
as an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the
priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I
paced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through
the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long
amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my
line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I
entered.  I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.

Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
skeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived
me taking the altitude of the final rib, "How now!" they shouted;
"Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us."  "Aye,
priests--well, how long do ye make him, then?"  But hereupon a fierce
contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked
each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull
echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own
admeasurements.

These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.  But first, be
it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
measurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you
can refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum,
they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that
country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other
whales.  Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in
New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call "the only perfect
specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States."
Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,
a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton
of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown
magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.

In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds.  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.  Sir
Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a
great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day
upon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors
and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a
bunch of keys at his side.  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence
for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence
to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for
the unrivalled view from his forehead.

The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of
preserving such valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,
and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a
poem I was then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might
remain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed,
should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the
whale.



CHAPTER 103

Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.


In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.

According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly
base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the
largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to
my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest
magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and
something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a
whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen
men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population
of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.

Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's
imagination?

Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far
the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated
concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your
mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a
complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.

In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two
feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some
fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for
something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular
basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.

To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.

The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was
nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last
only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they
all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs
were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for
beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.

In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton
of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The
largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that
part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the
greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must
have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib
measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only
conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that
part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all
that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,
muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here
saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and
majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!

How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to
try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over
his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.
Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings
of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the
fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.

But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But
now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.

There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks
on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The
largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,
and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers
away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something
like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller
ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the
priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we
see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off
at last into simple child's play.



CHAPTER 104

The Fossil Whale.


From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you, you could
not compress him.  By good rights he should only be treated of in
imperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to
tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the
gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like
great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck
of a line-of-battle-ship.

Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me
to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.  Having already described
him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities,
it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous,
and antediluvian point of view.  Applied to any other creature than
the Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be
deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,
the case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under
the weightiest words of the dictionary.  And here be it said, that
whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of
Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous
lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a
lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.

One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me, writing
of this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!  Give me Vesuvius' crater for an
inkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!  For in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with
their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the
whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and
men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the
revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole
universe, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
virtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.  To
produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  No great and
enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
who have tried it.

Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time
I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,
canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.
Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that
while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of
monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics
discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the
connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the
antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to
have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered
belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
superficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to
any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin
to them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as
Cetacean fossils.

Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their
bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various
intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in
France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is
part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue
Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the
palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the
great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these
fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic
species.

But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken
credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
fallen angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones
of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it
turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a
departed species.  A significant illustration of the fact, again and
again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes
but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.  So Owen
rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the
most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have
blotted out of existence.

When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances
to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing
on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back
to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;
for time began with man.  Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and
I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;
and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an
inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.  Then the whole world
was the whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can show a
pedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than
the Pharaoh's.  Methuselah seems a school-boy.  I look round to shake
hands with Shem.  I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.

But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to
claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the
unmistakable print of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple
of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the
granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in
centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures
on the celestial globe of the moderns.  Gliding among them, old
Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,
centuries before Solomon was cradled.

Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the
antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as
set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.  The Common People imagine,
that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can
pass it without immediate death.  But the truth of the Matter is,
that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two
Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.
They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which
lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch,
the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back.
This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years
before I saw it.  Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who
prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand
to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the
Base of the Temple."

In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be
a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.



CHAPTER 105

Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?


Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from
the original bulk of his sires.

But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its
earlier ones.

Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton.  Whereas, we have already
seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton
of a large sized modern whale.  And I have heard, on whalemen's
authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet
long at the time of capture.

But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;
may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?

Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.  For
Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in
length--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the
days of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish
member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales
(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;
that is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the French
naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning
of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred
metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.  And this work was
published so late as A.D. 1825.

But will any whaleman believe these stories?  No.  The whale of
to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.  And if ever I go
where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to
tell him so.  Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the
Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even
Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern
Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals
sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the
relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove
that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only
equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;
in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
whale alone should have degenerated.

But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
recondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient
look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even
through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted
along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan
can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether
he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last
whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself
evaporate in the final puff.

Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of
buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands
the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a
dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would
seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape
speedy extinction.

But you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short a
period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in
Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the
present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;
and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of
man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily
forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one ship
hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done
extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of
forty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian
hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset
suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of
moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse
instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
statistically stated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much
more remunerative.  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those
whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in
immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries,
yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into
vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And
equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called
whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.  For they
are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no
longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and
remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar
spectacle.

Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have
two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever
remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the
frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the
savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at
last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate
glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes;
and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all
pursuit from man.

But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that
this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their
battalions.  But though for some time past a number of these whales,
not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west
coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which
render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing
argument in this matter.

Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the
populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what
shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at
one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those
regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate
climes.  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,
which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by
Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the
East--if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the
great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate
in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,
Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
combined.

Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult
generations must be contemporary.  And what that is, we may soon
gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and
family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,
women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding
this countless host to the present human population of the globe.

Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
species, however perishable in his individuality.  He swam the seas
before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he
despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,
like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale
will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the
equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.



CHAPTER 106

Ahab's Leg.


The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence
to his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of
his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.
And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he
so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman
(it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly
enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional
twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all
appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.

And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to
the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.  For it
had not been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket,
that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and
insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable
casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it
had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it
without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely
cured.

Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that
all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct
issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the
most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as
inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with
every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like.
Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and
posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.
For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain
canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have
no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,
shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;
whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to
themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in
the deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab, while even the
highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness
lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their
diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among
the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of
all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round
harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods
themselves are not for ever glad.  The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark
in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.  With many other
particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to
some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after
the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every
revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
light.  But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at
least.  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary
recluseness.  And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege
of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above
hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by
Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the
land of spirits and of wails.  So that, through their zeal for him,
they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the
knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till
a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the
Pequod's decks.

But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the
air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or
not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he
took plain practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.

And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)
which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a
careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be
secured.  This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg
completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,
independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.
Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its
temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the
blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
whatever iron contrivances might be needed.



CHAPTER 107

The Carpenter.


Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.
But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part,
they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and
hereditary.  But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing
an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter
was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those
belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,
practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings
collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and
outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or
less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the
application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the
Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical
emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or
four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.  For not to
speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--repairing stove boats,
sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting
bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and
other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.

The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so
manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished
with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.
At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was
securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.

A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its
hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
straightway files it smaller.  A lost land-bird of strange plumage
strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman sprains his wrist:
the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.  Stubb longed for
vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;
screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter
symmetrically supplies the constellation.  A sailor takes a fancy to
wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.  Another
has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand
upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow
unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round
the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his
jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.

Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike
indifferent and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of
ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held
for capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously
accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all
this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.  But
not precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for
a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it
so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed
one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible
world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still
eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
foundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in
him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying
heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,
crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now
and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of Noah's ark.  Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no
moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward
clingings might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript
abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;
living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.  You
might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved
a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem
to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had
been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had
one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.  He
was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN
PARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little
swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.  So, if his superiors
wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do
was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for
tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.

Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not have
a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow
anomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of
quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But
there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or
more.  And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning
life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the
time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also
hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this
soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself
awake.



CHAPTER 108

Ahab and the Carpenter.

The Deck--First Night Watch.


(CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE-BENCH, AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO
LANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG, WHICH JOIST IS
FIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE.  SLABS OF IVORY, LEATHER STRAPS, PADS,
SCREWS, AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH.
FORWARD, THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN, WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS
AT WORK.)


Drat the file, and drat the bone!  That is hard which should be soft,
and that is soft which should be hard.  So we go, who file old jaws
and shinbones.  Let's try another.  Aye, now, this works better
(SNEEZES).  Halloa, this bone dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's
(SNEEZES)--yes it's (SNEEZES)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak!
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber.  Saw
a live tree, and you don't get this dust; amputate a live bone, and
you don't get it (SNEEZES).  Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a
hand, and let's have that ferule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready
for them presently.  Lucky now (SNEEZES) there's no knee-joint to
make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere shinbone--why it's
easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on.
Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat
a leg now as ever (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady in a parlor.  Those
buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop windows wouldn't
compare at all.  They soak water, they do; and of course get
rheumatic, and have to be doctored (SNEEZES) with washes and lotions,
just like live legs.  There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his
old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too
short, if anything, I guess.  Ha! that's the heel; we are in luck;
here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.

AHAB (ADVANCING)

(DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES)


Well, manmaker!

Just in time, sir.  If the captain pleases, I will now mark the
length.  Let me measure, sir.

Measured for a leg! good.  Well, it's not the first time.  About it!
There; keep thy finger on it.  This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
carpenter; let me feel its grip once.  So, so; it does pinch some.

Oh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!

No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold, man.  What's Prometheus about
there?--the blacksmith, I mean--what's he about?

He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.

Right.  It's a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.  He makes a
fierce red flame there!

Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

Um-m.  So he must.  I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that
old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made in fire must
properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable.  How the soot flies!
This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.
Carpenter, when he's through with that buckle, tell him to forge a
pair of steel shoulder-blades; there's a pedlar aboard with a
crushing pack.

Sir?

Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern.  Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then,
chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em,
to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no
heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine
brains; and let me see--shall I order eyes to see outwards?  No, but
put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.  There,
take the order, and away.

Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should
like to know?  Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).

'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here's one.
No, no, no; I must have a lantern.

Ho, ho!  That's it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.

I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.


Carpenter? why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an
extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,
carpenter;--or would'st thou rather work in clay?

Sir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.

The fellow's impious!  What art thou sneezing about?

Bone is rather dusty, sir.

Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
living people's noses.

Sir?--oh! ah!--I guess so;--yes--dear!

Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman, eh?  Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well
for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it;
that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean.
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?

Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.  Yes, I have heard
something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
pricking him at times.  May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

It is, man.  Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to
the soul.  Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there,
there to a hair, do I.  Is't a riddle?

I should humbly call it a poser, sir.

Hist, then.  How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking
thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing
precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy
spite?  In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear
eavesdroppers?  Hold, don't speak!  And if I still feel the smart of
my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst
not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and
without a body?  Hah!

Good Lord!  Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
again; I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.

Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before
the leg is done?

Perhaps an hour, sir.

Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO).  Oh, Life!
Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
blockhead for a bone to stand on!  Cursed be that mortal
inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.  I would be
free as air; and I'm down in the whole world's books.  I am so rich,
I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the
auction of the Roman empire (which was the world's); and yet I owe
for the flesh in the tongue I brag with.  By heavens!  I'll get a
crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,
compendious vertebra.  So.

CARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).


Well, well, well!  Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning
it into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very
queer.  And here's his leg!  Yes, now that I think of it, here's his
bedfellow! has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is
his leg; he'll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg
standing in three places, and all three places standing in one
hell--how was that?  Oh!  I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!
I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that's only
haphazard-like.  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never
undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built
captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and
there's a great cry for life-boats.  And here's the heron's leg! long
and slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a
lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a
tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.  But
Ahab; oh he's a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death, and
spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.
Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with
his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round
collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up again.  What a leg this
is!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the
core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes
on it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed
ivory, where he figures up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and
sand-paper, now!



CHAPTER 109

Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.


According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo!
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must
have sprung a bad leak.  Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went
down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*


*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
intervals, is removed by the ship's pumps.  Hereby the casks are
sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in
the precious cargo.


Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa
and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets
from the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab
with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white
new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a
long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,
with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and
tracing his old courses again.

"Who's there?" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning
round to it.  "On deck!  Begone!"

"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I.  The oil in the hold is leaking,
sir.  We must up Burtons and break out."

"Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to
here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"

"Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
good in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
saving, sir."

"So it is, so it is; if we get it."

"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."

"And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.  Begone!  Let it
leak!  I'm all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of
leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a
far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't stop to plug my
leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to
plug it, even if found, in this life's howling gale?  Starbuck!
I'll not have the Burtons hoisted."

"What will the owners say, sir?"

"Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.
What cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art always prating to me,
Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my
conscience.  But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its
commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On
deck!"

"Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the
cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it
almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest
outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than
half distrustful of itself; "A better man than I might well pass over
in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,
and in a happier, Captain Ahab."

"Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of
me?--On deck!"

"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be
forbearing!  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
Captain Ahab?"

Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"

For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery
cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the
blaze of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half
calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and
said: "Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask
thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab
beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man."

"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!"
murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  "What's that he said--Ahab
beware of Ahab--there's something there!"  Then unconsciously using
the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,
and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.

"Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the
mate; then raising his voice to the crew: "Furl the t'gallant-sails,
and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up
Burton, and break out in the main-hold."

It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as
respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of
honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the
circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open
disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of
his ship.  However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons
were hoisted.



CHAPTER 110

Queequeg in His Coffin.


Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.  So, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.  So deep did
they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the
lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy
corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of
the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the
flood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and
shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till
at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull
echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and
reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.
Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in
his head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.

Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him
nigh to his endless end.

Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
higher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg, who, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,
but--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea;
and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.  To be short, among
whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.

Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there;
where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was
crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted
lizard at the bottom of a well.  And a well, or an ice-house, it
somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the
heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a
fever; and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his
hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted
and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed
but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all else
in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,
nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a
strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you
there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health
in him which could not die, or be weakened.  And like circles on the
water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed
rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld
who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly
wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.
And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike
impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the
dead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--no dying
Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose
mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as
he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed
gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible
flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day
was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket
he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the
rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned
that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark
canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for
it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a
dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be
floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they
believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible
horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue
heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,
that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of
Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like
a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that
involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.

Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might
include.  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber
aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the
aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks
the coffin was recommended to be made.  No sooner was the carpenter
apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all
the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the
forecastle and took Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly
chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.

"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island
sailor.

Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and
general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length
the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting
two notches at its extremities.  This done, he marshalled the planks
and his tools, and to work.

When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every
one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly
brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all
mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since
they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows
ought to be indulged.

Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with
an attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden
stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin
along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,
also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of
fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth
scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being
rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his
final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.
He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag
and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his
breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he
called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a
leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but
his composed countenance in view.  "Rarmai" (it will do; it is easy),
he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.

But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,
took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.

"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?
where go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet
Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye
do one little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now been
missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles.  If ye find him,
then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his
tambourine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,
die; and I'll beat ye your dying march."

"I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in
violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;
and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in
their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been
really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.  So, to my
fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings
heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.  Where learned he that,
but there?--Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now."

"Form two and two!  Let's make a General of him!  Ho, where's his
harpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a
game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!  Queequeg dies
game!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that;
Queequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he
died a coward; died all a'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find
Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a runaway; a coward, a coward, a
coward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat!  I'd never beat my
tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more
dying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--shame upon them!  Let 'em
go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.  Shame! shame!"

During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.
Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;
soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,
when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,
that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical
moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was
leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he
could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live
or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He
answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a
man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:
nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and
civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months
convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well
again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at
length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but
eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,
threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned
a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,
and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.

With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed
prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had
written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the
earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that
Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous
work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,
though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were
therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living
parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
last.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab
that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from
surveying poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!"



CHAPTER 111

The Pacific.


When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
thousand leagues of blue.

There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose
gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath;
like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried
Evangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,
wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four
continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow
unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned
dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,
lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;
the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.

To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,
must ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost
waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its
arms.  The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian
towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave
the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than
Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and
low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.
Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk
about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart
of earth.  Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the
seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.

But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with
one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee
isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with
the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;
that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.
Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding
towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose
intensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the
Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his
very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, "Stern all!
the White Whale spouts thick blood!"



CHAPTER 112

The Blacksmith.


Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned
in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered
old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,
after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still
retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being
now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and
bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or
new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.  Often he would
be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding
boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching
his every sooty movement, as he toiled.  Nevertheless, this old man's
was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no
impatience, no petulance did come from him.  Silent, slow, and
solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he
toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of
his hammer the heavy beating of his heart.  And so it was.--Most
miserable!

A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful
appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage
excited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity of
their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came
to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched
fate.

Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the
road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly
felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a
leaning, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the
extremities of both feet.  Out of this revelation, part by part, at
last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as
yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.

He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin.  He had
been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a
house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife,
and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a
cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.  But one night, under
cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning
disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and
robbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to tell, the
blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his
family's heart.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of
that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.
Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's
shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate
entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife
listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to
the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose
reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came
up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's
iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin
came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and
her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their
after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.  But Death
plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily
toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left
the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life
should make him easier to harvest.

Why tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the
bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;
the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children
twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man
staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his
grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!

Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but
Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it
is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense
Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the
death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some
interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and
all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of
unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and
from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to
them--"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the
guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without
dying for them.  Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your
now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious
than death.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the
churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!"

Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come!  And so
Perth went a-whaling.



CHAPTER 113

The Forge.


With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in
the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab
came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.
While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till
at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering
it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick
hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.

"Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying
in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,
they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch."

"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth,
resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily
can'st thou scorch a scar."

"Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely
woeful to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in
others that is not mad.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why
dost thou not go mad?  How can'st thou endure without being mad?  Do
the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert
thou making there?"

"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."

"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such
hard usage as it had?"

"I think so, sir."

"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"

"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."

"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye
smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across
his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I
lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my
eyes.  Answer!  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"

"Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?"

"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
the bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, away with child's
play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye here!" jingling the
leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.  "I, too, want a
harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part,
Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.
There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil.  "Look ye,
blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of
racing horses."

"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,
the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work."

"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from
the melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.  And
forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and
hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a
tow-line.  Quick!  I'll blow the fire."

When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,
by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.
"A flaw!" rejecting the last one.  "Work that over again, Perth."

This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  As, then,
with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing
to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed
forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed
silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking
some curse or some blessing on the toil.  But, as Ahab looked up, he
slid aside.

"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered
Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.  "That Parsee smells fire like
a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."

At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and
as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water
near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.

"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain;
"have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?"

"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this
harpoon for the White Whale?"

"For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make them
thyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make
the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."

For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
fain not use them.

"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,
sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!"

Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.

"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.
Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will
ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high
up.  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made
in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.

"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"
deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured
the baptismal blood.

Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and
some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great
tension.  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a
harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings,
Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and now for the seizings."

At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread
yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the
pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the
rope was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured
so, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and
rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily
stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the
sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.
But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet
most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy
idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly
blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!



CHAPTER 114

The Gilder.


Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese
cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.
Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and
twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily
pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an
interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising;
though with but small success for their pains.

At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like
hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times
of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy
of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath
it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but
conceals a remorseless fang.

These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through
high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:
as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears,
while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.

The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
the flowers of the woods are plucked.  And all this mixes with your
most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,
interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.

Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden keys did
seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his
breath upon them prove but tarnishing.

Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy
life,--in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning
clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the
life immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.
But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof:
calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.  There is no steady
unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed
gradations, and at the last one pause:--through infancy's unconscious
spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common
doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's
pondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round
again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.  Where lies
the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?  In what rapt ether sails
the world, of which the weariest will never weary?  Where is the
foundling's father hidden?  Our souls are like those orphans whose
unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity
lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.

And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into
that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--

"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's
eye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways.  Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look
deep down and do believe."

And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
golden light:--

"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths
that he has always been jolly!"



CHAPTER 115

The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.


And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing
down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been
welded.

It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground,
previous to pointing her prow for home.

The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns, and
jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels
of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender
breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was
a brazen lamp.

As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising
in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months
without securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef and
bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm,
but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the
ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the
captain's and officers' state-rooms.  Even the cabin table itself
had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the
broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
centrepiece.  In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked
and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,
that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled
it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;
that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled
them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the
captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his
hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.

As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and
drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her
huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach
skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
clenched hands of the crew.  On the quarter-deck, the mates and
harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped
with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an
ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and
mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of
whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.  Meanwhile,
others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of
the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.  You would
have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were
being hurled into the sea.

Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's
wakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all
forebodings as to things to come--their two captains in themselves
impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.

"Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander,
lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.

"Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.

"No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the
other good-humoredly.  "Come aboard!"

"Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?"

"Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,
old hearty, come along.  I'll soon take that black from your brow.
Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and
homeward-bound."

"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou
art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me
an empty ship, and outward-bound.  So go thy ways, and I will mine.
Forward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"

And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the
other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;
the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards
the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their
gaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over
the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a
small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,
seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that
vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.



CHAPTER 116

The Dying Whale.


Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites
sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.  So
seemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering the gay
Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by
Ahab.

It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and
sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness
and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that
rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green
convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,
wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper
hymns.

Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had
sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings
from the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in
all sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so
expiring--that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening,
somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.

"He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.  He
too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the
sun!--Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring
sights.  Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal
or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions
no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows
have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine
upon the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full
of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the
corpse, and it heads some other way.

"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast
builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these
unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly
speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed
burial of its after calm.  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his
dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.

"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,
rainbowed jet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!  In
vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.  Yet dost
thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.  All
thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by
breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.

"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;
though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my
foster-brothers!"



CHAPTER 117

The Whale Watch.


The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern.
These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the
windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had
killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.

The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole;
and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering
glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight
waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf
upon a beach.

Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.
A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.

Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world.  "I have dreamed it again," said he.

"Of the hearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?"

"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"

"But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
America."

"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers.  Ha!
Such a sight we shall not soon see."

"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."

"And what was that saying about thyself?"

"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."

"And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I
can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it
not so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have
here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."

"Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted
up like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."

"The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,"
cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"

Both were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on, and the
slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship.



CHAPTER 118

The Quadrant.


The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman
would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners
quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes
centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to
point the ship's prow for the equator.  In good time the order came.
It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his
high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of
the sun to determine his latitude.

Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass.  The sky
looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
God's throne.  Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured
glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire.  So,
swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in
that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the
sun should gain its precise meridian.  Meantime while his whole
attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the
ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same
sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and
his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.  At length
the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory
leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise
instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up
towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high
and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou
cast the least hint where I SHALL be?  Or canst thou tell where some
other thing besides me is this moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?
This instant thou must be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into
the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye
that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
thither side of thee, thou sun!"

Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
"Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
holds thee: no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop
of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with
thy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee, thou
vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to
that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes
are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!  Level by nature to this
earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the
crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.
Curse thee, thou quadrant!" dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I
guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level
deadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall conduct me, and show
me my place on the sea.  Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck,
"thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on
high; thus I split and destroy thee!"

As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over
the mute, motionless Parsee's face.  Unobserved he rose and glided
away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen
clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing
the deck, shouted out--"To the braces!  Up helm!--square in!"

In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled
upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised
upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting
on one sufficient steed.

Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's
tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.

"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!"

"Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.
Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well; I heard
Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands
of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'  And damn me,
Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!"



CHAPTER 119

The Candles.


Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.  Skies the most
effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.  So, too, it is, that
in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst
of all storms, the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that
cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled
masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of
the tempest had left for its after sport.

Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
lashing of the boats.  But all their pains seemed naught.  Though
lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat
(Ahab's) did not escape.  A great rolling sea, dashing high up
against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's
bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a
sieve.

"Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
"but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can't fight it.  You
see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it
leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But
as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck
here.  But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song
says;"--(SINGS.)

Oh! jolly is the gale,
And a joker is the whale,
A' flourishin' his tail,--
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

The scud all a flyin',
That's his flip only foamin';
When he stirs in the spicin',--
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

Thunder splits the ships,
But he only smacks his lips,
A tastin' of this flip,--
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!


"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
thy peace."

"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a
coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.  And I tell you what it is,
Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to
cut my throat.  And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the
doxology for a wind-up."

"Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."

"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,
never mind how foolish?"

"Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing
his hand towards the weather bow, "markest thou not that the gale
comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby
Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat
there; where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is
wont to stand--his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard,
and sing away, if thou must!

"I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?"

"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's
question.  "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn
it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to
windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see
it lightens up there; but not with the lightning."

At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,
following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at
the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

"Who's there?"

"Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by
elbowed lances of fire.

Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry
off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea
some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the
water.  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,
that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if
kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,
besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more
or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this,
the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard;
but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more
readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the
sea, as occasion may require.

"The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post.  "Are they overboard? drop them
over, fore and aft.  Quick!"

"Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the
weaker side.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let
them be, sir."

"Look aloft!" cried Starbuck.  "The corpusants! the corpusants!

All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each
of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,
like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

"Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a
swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its
gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.
"Blast it!"--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes
caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The
corpusants have mercy on us all!"

To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance
of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate
curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a
seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common
oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His
"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the
cordage.

While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from
the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
constellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light, the
gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.  The parted
mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
the preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic
blue flames on his body.

The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once
more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.
A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against
some one.  It was Stubb.  "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy
cry; it was not the same in the song."

"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
hope they will, still.  But do they only have mercy on long
faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?  And look ye, Mr.
Starbuck--but it's too dark to look.  Hear me, then: I take that
mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are
rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil,
d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like
sap in a tree.  Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti
candles--that's the good promise we saw."

At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and
once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed
redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.

"The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.

At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the
flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head
bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging
rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number
of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung
pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.
In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or
running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;
but all their eyes upcast.

"Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab.  "Look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me those mainmast
links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
it; blood against fire!  So."

Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right
arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.

"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and
I now know that thy right worship is defiance.  To neither love nor
reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill;
and all are killed.  No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy
speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake
life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.  In the
midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.
Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go;
yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and
feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in
thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest
navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still
remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest
me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee."

[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP
LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,
CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]

"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?  Nor was it
wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.  Thou canst blind; but
I can then grope.  Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.  Take
the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.  I would not take
it.  The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and
ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some
stunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.
Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness
leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!  The javelins cease; open
eyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!  Oh, thou magnanimous! now
I do glory in my genealogy.  But thou art but my fiery father; my
sweet mother, I know not.  Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?
There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how
came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me, which
thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.  There is some
unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy
eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through thee,
thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.  Oh, thou
foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy
incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.  Here again with
haughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I
leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee;
defyingly I worship thee!"

"The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"

Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly
lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his
whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused
the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb
there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.  As the silent
harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab
by the arm--"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an
ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while
we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a
better voyage than this."

Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces--though not a sail was left aloft.  For the moment all the
aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous
cry.  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and
snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;
swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a
rope's end.  Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from
the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab
again spoke:--

"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.  And that
ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow
out the last fear!"  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished
the flame.

As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood
of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render
it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners
did run from him in a terror of dismay.



CHAPTER 120

The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.

AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM.  STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM.


We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir.  The band is working
loose and the lee lift is half-stranded.  Shall I strike it, sir?"

"Strike nothing; lash it.  If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up
now."

"Sir!--in God's name!--sir?"

"Well."

"The anchors are working, sir.  Shall I get them inboard?"

"Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything.  The wind
rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet.  Quick, and see
to it.--By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper
of some coasting smack.  Send down my main-top-sail yard!  Ho,
gluepots!  Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this
brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.  Shall I strike
that?  Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest
time.  What a hooroosh aloft there!  I would e'en take it for
sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.  Oh, take
medicine, take medicine!"



CHAPTER 121

Midnight.--The Forecastle Bulwarks.


STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER
THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.


No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
you will never pound into me what you were just now saying.  And how
long ago is it since you said the very contrary?  Didn't you once say
that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something
extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with
powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn't
you say so?"

"Well, suppose I did?  What then?  I've part changed my flesh since
that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with
powder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the
lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here?  Why, my little man,
you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake
yourself; you're Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill
pitchers at your coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these
extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the
other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor
here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.  What's the mighty
difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm, and
standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in
a storm?  Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to
the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?  What are you
talking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and
Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my
poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing
the seas.  Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every
man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the
corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather, and
trailing behind like his sash.  Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can
be sensible."

"I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard."

"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible,
that's a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;
catch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down
these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.
Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands
behind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.  These
are your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!  I wonder,
Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings
with an uncommon long cable, though.  There, hammer that knot down,
and we've done.  So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the
most satisfactory.  I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?
Thank ye.  They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.  The
tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see.
Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.
No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a
swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.  Halloa! whew! there goes
my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from
heaven should be so unmannerly!  This is a nasty night, lad."



CHAPTER 122

Midnight Aloft.--Thunder and Lightning.


THE MAIN-TOP-SAIL YARD.--TASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND IT.


"Um, um, um.  Stop that thunder!  Plenty too much thunder up here.
What's the use of thunder?  Um, um, um.  We don't want thunder; we
want rum; give us a glass of rum.  Um, um, um!"



CHAPTER 123

The Musket.


During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the
Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to
the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had
been attached to it--for they were slack--because some play to the
tiller was indispensable.

In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed
shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the
needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.  It was
thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not
failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon
the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some
sort of unwonted emotion.

Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through
the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward
and the other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away
to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are
cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.

The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,
East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
given to the helmsman.  For during the violence of the gale, he had
only steered according to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now
bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the
compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round
astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!

Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "HO! THE FAIR
WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the crew singing for joy, that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding it.

In compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report
immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
change in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed
the yards to the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he
mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.

Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
moment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was
burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's
bolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of
upper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a
certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by
all the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack were
shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward
bulkhead.  Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's
heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely
evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good
accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.

"He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very
musket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let
me touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have handled so many
deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.  Loaded?  I must
see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--that's not good.  Best spill
it?--wait.  I'll cure myself of this.  I'll hold the musket boldly
while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him.  But how fair?
Fair for death and doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick.  It's a fair
wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he
pointed at me!--the very one; THIS one--I hold it here; he would have
killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain
kill all his crew.  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to
any gale?  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same
perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the
error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
he would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old man be
tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with
him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm,
my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he
were this instant--put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he
muttering in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping.
Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.  I can't
withstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not
entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.  Flat
obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.  Aye,
and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.
Great God forbid!--But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make
him a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man's
living power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.
Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more
hideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could not endure the sight;
could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.
What, then, remains?  The land is hundreds of leagues away, and
locked Japan the nearest.  I stand alone here upon an open sea, with
two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis
so.--Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be
murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I
be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways
looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.

"On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way.  A
touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh
Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old
man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day
week may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall
I? shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and
main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course."

"Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"

Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb
dream to speak.

The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the
panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the
door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.

"He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and
tell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know'st what to say."



CHAPTER 124

The Needle.


Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her
on like giants' palms outspread.  The strong, unstaggering breeze
abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the
whole world boomed before the wind.  Muffled in the full morning
light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of
his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,
as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.
The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with
light and heat.

Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every
time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he
turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she
profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's
rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his
undeviating wake.

"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
of the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun
to ye!  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the
sea!"

But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.

"East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.

"Thou liest!" smiting him with his clenched fist.  "Heading East at
this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"

Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its
very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.

Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one
glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment
he almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind him Starbuck looked,
and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as
infallibly going West.

But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it!  It has happened
before.  Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our
compasses--that's all.  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I
take it."

"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale
mate, gloomily.

Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more
than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.  The magnetic
energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know,
essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is
not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.  Instances
where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite
down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at
times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being
annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use
than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle
never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate
reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the
lowermost one inserted into the kelson.

Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the
transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended
hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the
needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's
course to be changed accordingly.  The yards were hard up; and once
more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for
the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.

Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
Flask--who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
feelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, though
some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their
fear of Fate.  But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained
almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a
certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible
Ahab's.

For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.  But
chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.

"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked
thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.  So, so.
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a lance
without a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's
needles.  Quick!"

Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now
about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have
been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile
skill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.
Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,
though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by
superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.

"Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder turned old
Ahab's needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his
own, that will point as true as any."

Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
might follow.  But Starbuck looked away.

With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.  Then, with the
maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as
before.  Then going through some small strange motions with
it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely
intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--he called for
linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two
reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by
its middle, over one of the compass-cards.  At first, the steel went
round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last
it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching
for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing
his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look ye, for yourselves,
if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!  The sun is East, and
that compass swears it!"

One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes
could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they
slunk away.

In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
fatal pride.



CHAPTER 125

The Log and Line.


While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the
log and line had but very seldom been in use.  Owing to a confident
reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some
merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly
neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently
more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon
the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the
presumed average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus
with the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long
untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.  Rains and
spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the elements
had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.  But heedless of all
this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his
quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level
log and line.  The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows
rolled in riots.

"Forward, there!  Heave the log!"

Two seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
"Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."

They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where
the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping
into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.

The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,
so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced
to him.

Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
speak.

"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it."

"'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled
thee?  Thou seem'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee;
not thou it."

"I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.  With these
grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a
superior, who'll ne'er confess."

"What's that?  There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient.  Where
wert thou born?"

"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."

"Excellent!  Thou'st hit the world by that."

"I know not, sir, but I was born there."

"In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it's good.  Here's a
man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of
Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!  The dead, blind
wall butts all inquiring heads at last.  Up with it!  So."

The log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a
long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to
whirl.  In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows,
the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger
strangely.

"Hold hard!"

Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
tugging log was gone.

"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
sea parts the log-line.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in here,
Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make
another log, and mend thou the line.  See to it."

"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer
seems loosening out of the middle of the world.  Haul in, haul in,
Tahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,
and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"

"Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whale-boat.  Pip's
missing.  Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman.
It drags hard; I guess he's holding on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him
off; we haul in no cowards here.  Ho! there's his arm just breaking
water.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.
Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."

"Peace, thou crazy loon," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
"Away from the quarter-deck!"

"The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser," muttered Ahab, advancing.
"Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?

"Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!"

"And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils
of thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls
to sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?"

"Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One
hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks
cowardly--quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip
the coward?"

"There can be no hearts above the snow-line.  Oh, ye frozen heavens!
look down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's
home henceforth, while Ahab lives.  Thou touchest my inmost centre,
boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.  Come,
let's down."

"What's this? here's velvet shark-skin," intently gazing at Ahab's
hand, and feeling it.  "Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a
thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost!  This seems to me,
sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by.  Oh, sir,
let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black
one with the white, for I will not let this go."

"Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here.  Come, then, to my cabin.  Lo! ye believers in
gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient
gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing
not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.
Come!  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I
grasped an Emperor's!"

"There go two daft ones now," muttered the old Manxman.  "One daft
with strength, the other daft with weakness.  But here's the end of
the rotten line--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I think we had
best have a new line altogether.  I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."



CHAPTER 126

The Life-Buoy.


Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her
progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod
held on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long a passage
through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long,
sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously
mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous
and desperate scene.

At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then
headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their
reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned
all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that
wild cry remained within hearing.  The Christian or civilized part of
the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan
harpooneers remained unappalled.  Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest
mariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were
heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.

Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed, and
thus explained the wonder.

Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
wail.  But this only the more affected some of them, because most
mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising
not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from
the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
peeringly uprising from the water alongside.  In the sea, under
certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for
men.

But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.  At
sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was
thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,
he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a
rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of
the sea.

The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where
it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had
shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also
filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed
the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in
sooth but a hard one.

And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look
out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground;
that man was swallowed up in the deep.  But few, perhaps, thought of
that at the time.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at
this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a
foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an
evil already presaged.  They declared that now they knew the reason
of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the
old Manxman said nay.

The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to
see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and
as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was
directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to
be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided
with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg
hinted a hint concerning his coffin.

"A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.

"Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.

"It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can
arrange it easily."

"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a
melancholy pause.  "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the
coffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it."

"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a
hammer.

"Aye."

"And shall I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his hand as with a
caulking-iron.

"Aye."

"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand
as with a pitch-pot.

"Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,
and no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."

"He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts he
baulks.  Now I don't like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and
he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and
he won't put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing
with that coffin?  And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.
It's like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other
side now.  I don't like this cobbling sort of business--I don't like
it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place.  Let tinkers' brats
do tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take in hand none but
clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that
regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway,
and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at
an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.  It's the old
woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection
all old women have for tinkers.  I know an old woman of sixty-five
who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.  And that's the
reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I
kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their
lonely old heads to run off with me.  But heigh-ho! there are no caps
at sea but snow-caps.  Let me see.  Nail down the lid; caulk the
seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang
it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern.  Were ever such things
done before with a coffin?  Some superstitious old carpenters, now,
would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.  But I'm
made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge.  Cruppered with a
coffin!  Sailing about with a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We
workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as
coffins and hearses.  We work by the month, or by the job, or by the
profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless
it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!
I'll do the job, now, tenderly.  I'll have me--let's see--how many in
the ship's company, all told?  But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll
have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet
long hanging all round to the coffin.  Then, if the hull go down,
there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a
sight not seen very often beneath the sun!  Come hammer,
caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!  Let's to it."



CHAPTER 127

The Deck.


THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE
OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF
TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE
BOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND
HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.


Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently.  He goes!  Not this
hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle
aisle of a church!  What's here?"

"Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck's orders.  Oh, look, sir!  Beware the
hatchway!"

"Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault."

"Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it does, sir, so it does."

"Art not thou the leg-maker?  Look, did not this stump come from thy
shop?"

"I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?"

"Well enough.  But art thou not also the undertaker?"

"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
they've set me now to turning it into something else."

"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and
the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of
those same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as
much of a jack-of-all-trades."

"But I do not mean anything, sir.  I do as I do."

"The gods again.  Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin?  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade
in hand.  Dost thou never?"

"Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that;
but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because
there was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of
it.  Hark to it."

"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what
in all things makes the sounding-board is this--there's naught
beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the
same, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the
coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?

"Faith, sir, I've--"

"Faith?  What's that?"

"Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,
sir."

"Um, um; go on."

"I was about to say, sir, that--"

"Art thou a silk-worm?  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight."

"He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.  Seems to me
some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.
He's always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!  He's looking this
way--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.  This wooden mallet is
the cork, and I'm the professor of musical glasses--tap, tap!"

(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)

"There's a sight!  There's a sound!  The grey-headed woodpecker
tapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.
See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.  A most
malicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat!  So man's seconds tick!  Oh!
how immaterial are all materials!  What things real are there, but
imponderable thoughts?  Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim
death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope
of most endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go
further?  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after
all, but an immortality-preserver!  I'll think of that.  But no.  So
far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the
theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.  Will ye
never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?  I go below;
let me not see that thing here when I return again.  Now, then, Pip,
we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee!
Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!"



CHAPTER 128

The Pequod Meets The Rachel.


Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly
down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.  At
the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as
the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful
sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all
life fled from the smitten hull.

"Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman.  But ere
her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere
he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.

"Hast seen the White Whale?"

"Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"

Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected
question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the
stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen
descending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon
clinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.  But
no formal salutation was exchanged.

"Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely
advancing.  "How was it?"

It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of
whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and
head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very
far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--a reserved
one--had been instantly lowered in chase.  After a keen sail before
the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to
have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the
mast-head could tell anything about it.  In the distance he saw the
diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white
water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the
stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as
often happens.  There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,
as yet.  The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came
on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going
in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--the
ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate
till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from
it.  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a
fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the
look-out.  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance
to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though
she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and
not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered
her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;
yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.

The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal
his object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite
with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five
miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as
it were.

"I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some
one in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap,
his watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of
two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the
height of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he
looks--pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the
coat--it must have been the--"

"My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God's sake--I beg, I
conjure"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
had but icily received his petition.  "For eight-and-forty hours let
me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for
it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only
that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing."

"His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost!  I take back the
coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy."

"He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx
sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their
spirits."

Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the
Rachel's the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was
one of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's
crew; but among the number of the other boat's crews, at the same
time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark
vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that
for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the
cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief
mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship
in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but
divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.  But the
captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did
he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years
old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a
Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in
the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny
of all his race.  Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket
captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a
protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their
own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be
unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely
partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of
Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but
without the least quivering of his own.

"I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me.  Do to
me as you would have me do to you in the like case.  For YOU too have
a boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home
now--a child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see
it--run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards."

"Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word--"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
Even now I lose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bless ye, man, and
may I forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the
binnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn
off all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail
as before."

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and
utter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But starting from his
enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than
stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.

Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange
vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every
dark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards
were swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;
now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;
while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with
men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among
the boughs.

But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
comfort.  She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
not.



CHAPTER 129

The Cabin.


(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)

Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.  The hour is
coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have
thee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too
curing to my malady.  Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady
becomes my most desired health.  Do thou abide below here, where they
shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt
sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be."

"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I
remain a part of ye."

"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
fidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks
like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again."

"They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living
skin.  But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.  Sir, I
must go with ye."

"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in
him.  I tell thee no; it cannot be."

"Oh good master, master, master!

"Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and
still know that I am there.  And now I quit thee.  Thy hand!--Met!
True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre.  So: God for
ever bless thee; and if it come to that,--God for ever save thee, let
what will befall."

(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)


"Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,--but I'm alone.
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing.
Pip!  Pip!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip?  He must be up here;
let's try the door.  What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet
there's no opening it.  It must be the spell; he told me to stay
here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.  Here, then, I'll
seat me, against the transom, in the ship's full middle, all her keel
and her three masts before me.  Here, our old sailors say, in their
black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord
it over rows of captains and lieutenants.  Ha! what's this? epaulets!
epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding!  Pass round the decanters;
glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs!  What an odd feeling, now, when a
black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their
coats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--a little negro lad, five
feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!  Jumped from a whale-boat
once;--seen him?  No!  Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's
drink shame upon all cowards!  I name no names.  Shame upon them!
Put one foot upon the table.  Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above
there, I hear ivory--Oh, master! master!  I am indeed down-hearted
when you walk over me.  But here I'll stay, though this stern
strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me."



CHAPTER 130

The Hat.


And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to
have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with
various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac
indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether
sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something
in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble
souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the
livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady,
central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the
constant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,
that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide
beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.

In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
mortar of Ahab's iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about
the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.

But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;
when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have
seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable
Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at
times affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to
invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;
that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,
whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow
cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body.  And that shadow was
always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever
certainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still
for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.

Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon
the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his
pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating
limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing
in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if
to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however
motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that
he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching
hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes
were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently
scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a
whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in
beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that
the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,
day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the
planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.

He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast
and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which
darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,
which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper
verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;
and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his
own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the
other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made
it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the
twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like
asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb
men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.
At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far
parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the
mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his
abandoned substance.

And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab
seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again
both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the
lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all
rib and keel was solid Ahab.

At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was
heard from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day,
till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at
the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye
see?--sharp! sharp!"

But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the
monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at
least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to
doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the
sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he
sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his
actions might seem to hint them.

"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--he said.  "Aye!
Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest
of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of
the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a
pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,
with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked
round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his
glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;
and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,
said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck."
Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to
hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope
at last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand
clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for
miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the
wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.

When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea
is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under
these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in
strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.
Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various
different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by
what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these
ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it
would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant
watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew
be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's
proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing
about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this
was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.

Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a
thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,
and went eddying again round his head.

But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have
marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost
the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in
almost every sight.

"Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,
though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air
dividing them.

But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long
hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away
with his prize.

An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to
replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin
would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that
omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk
flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last
disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute
black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into
the sea.



CHAPTER 131

The Pequod Meets The Delight.


The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most
miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.  As she drew nigh, all
eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.

Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but
you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the
peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

"Hast seen the White Whale?"

"Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and
with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.

"Hast killed him?"

"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the
other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.

"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch,
Ahab held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this
hand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning
are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place
behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"

"Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the
hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night.  Only THAT one I bury; the rest
were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb."  Then
turning to his crew--"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the
rail, and lift the body; so, then--Oh!  God"--advancing towards the
hammock with uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life--"

"Brace forward!  Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.

But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;
not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.

As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.

"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
"In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us
your taffrail to show us your coffin!"



CHAPTER 132

The Symphony.


It was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air
was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust
and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as
Samson's chest in his sleep.

Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.

But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades
and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it
were, that distinguished them.

Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  And at the
girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen
here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.

Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly
firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in
the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of
the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
forehead of heaven.

Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us!  Sweet childhood of air and sky!
how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe!  But so have I
seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol
around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which
grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.

Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,
the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  But
the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,
for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad, happy air,
that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother
world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round
his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over
one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her
heart to save and to bless.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab
dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
wealth as that one wee drop.

Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the
side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless
sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  Careful
not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and
stood there.

Ahab turned.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir."

"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  On
such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first
whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--forty years
ago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of
privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless
sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty
years to make war on the horrors of the deep!  Aye and yes, Starbuck,
out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.  When I think
of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the
masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but
small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh,
weariness! heaviness!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary
command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so
keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon
dry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when
the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and
broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole
oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my
marriage pillow--wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!
Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and
then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking
brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,
foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a
forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Why this
strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the
iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?  Behold.
Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one
poor leg should have been snatched from under me?  Here, brush this
old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did
never grow but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,
very old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as
though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since
Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my
brain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have
I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably
old?  Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human
eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze
upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the
magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  No, no;
stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no!
not with the far away home I see in that eye!"

"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
why should any one give chase to that hated fish!  Away with me! let
us fly these deadly waters! let us home!  Wife and child, too, are
Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
longing, paternal old age!  Away! let us away!--this instant let me
alter the course!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would
we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they
have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."

"They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days in the
morning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy
vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come
back to dance him again."

"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy, every
morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
his father's sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the
hill!"

But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,
and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.

"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst
not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, that
lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an
errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some
invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one
small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that
thinking, does that living, and not I.  By heaven, man, we are turned
round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the
handspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
unsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase
and fang that flying-fish?  Where do murderers go, man!  Who's to
doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is a
mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as
if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay
somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are
sleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,
we all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid
greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut
swaths--Starbuck!"

But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen
away.

Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Fedallah was
motionlessly leaning over the same rail.



CHAPTER 133

The Chase--First Day.


That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at
intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,
snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing
nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.
Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by
the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any
mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the
dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as
nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be
slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.

The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently
vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea
directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the
pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like
marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

"Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!"

Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the
forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps
that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did
they appear with their clothes in their hands.

"What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.

"Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.

"T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"

All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they
were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way
aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between
the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in
the air.  "There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a
snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!"

Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final
perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's
head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the
whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea
revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent
spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same
silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and
Indian Oceans.

"And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched
men all around him.

"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and
I cried out," said Tashtego.

"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised
the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there
she blows!  There again!--there again!" he cried, in long-drawn,
lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
whale's visible jets.  "He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down
top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,
stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!
So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!
All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.
Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he slid through the air
to the deck.

"He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away
from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."

"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!
Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!"

Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails
set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up
Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the
sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the
ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;
seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the
breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his
entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as
if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of
finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of
the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft
Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his
broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the
shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into
the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by
the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,
alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff
rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered
pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at
intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and
fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked
on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.

A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away
with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,
leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching
fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not
Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White
Whale as he so divinely swam.

On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once
leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale
shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters
who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had
ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the
vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou
glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how
many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed
before.

And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,
among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,
Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of
his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his
jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for
an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like
Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes
in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of
sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white
sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.

With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's
reappearance.

"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he
gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide
wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his
eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.
The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.

"The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.

In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were
now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with
joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab
could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down
and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no
bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and
magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly
revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating
up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and
scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the
blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like
an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his
steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous
apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,
went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his
crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.

Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet
under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with
that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
lengthwise beneath the boat.

Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled
for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner
of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within
his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high
up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The
bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of
Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the
White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her
mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;
but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to
gain the uttermost stern.

And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as
the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and
from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be
darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as
it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a
quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac
Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed
him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with
all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly
strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,
the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and
snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,
bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again
in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated
aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging
to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them
across.

At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the
first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his
head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment
his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.
But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over
sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;
spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell
flat-faced upon the sea.

Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in
the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled
body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or
more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their
confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing
their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the
but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the
Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.


*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its
designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must
best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling
him.


But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly
round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his
vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more
deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden
him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's
elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in
the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to
swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a
whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed
bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's
fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the
clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more
than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so
revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so
planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he
seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,
unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the
eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,
then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose
centre had now become the old man's head.

Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the
ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon
the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed
her!--"Sail on the"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him
from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of
it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he
shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!"

The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he
sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.

Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily
strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for
a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one
trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails
came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.

But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the
more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes
condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains
kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such
hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods
decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly
made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless
centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of
inferior souls.

"The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
one bended arm--"is it safe?"

"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing
it.

"Lay it before me;--any missing men?"

"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here
are five men."

"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!
there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands
off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the
sail; out oars; the helm!"

It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being
picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the
chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It
was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the
added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his
every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if
now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an
indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew
endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining
at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered
the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.
Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to
their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been
previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,
and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with
stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod
bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,
methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly
announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported
as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon
now?  D'ye see him?" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he
commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore
on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the
planks.

As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to
a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched
hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been
dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to
shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already
over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,
so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as
this.

Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place
in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck
exclaimed--"The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too
keenly, sir; ha! ha!"

"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?  Man, man!
did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I
could swear thou wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh should be heard
before a wreck."

"Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight; an
omen, and an ill one."

"Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are the opposite
poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is
Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the
millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!  Cold,
cold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!  D'ye see him?  Sing out for
every spout, though he spout ten times a second!"

The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was
rustling.  Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still
remained unset.

"Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark"--cried a voice from the
air.

"How heading when last seen?"

"As before, sir,--straight to leeward."

"Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night.  Down royals and
top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him
before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.
Helm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr.
Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned
till morning."--Then advancing towards the doubloon in the
main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let
it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye
first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that
man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times
its sum shall be divided among all of ye!  Away now!--the deck is
thine, sir!"

And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
rousing himself to see how the night wore on.



CHAPTER 134

The Chase--Second Day.


At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.

"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the
light to spread.

"See nothing, sir."

"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her
all night.  But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."

Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day,
is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.  For
such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the
Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale
when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,
pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will
continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his
probable rate of progression during that period.  And, in these
cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose
general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to
return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his
compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently
marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures
the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost
as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's
coast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the
proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.  And as
the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly
known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time
his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,
the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at
such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours
hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about
reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.  But to render
this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea
must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the
becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?  Inferable
from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching
the chase of whales.

The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
field.

"By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck
creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I are
two brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,
spine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel.  Ha,
ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!"

"There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the
mast-head cry.

"Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and
split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
your trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a
miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!"

And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.  The
frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,
like old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some
of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of
sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and
on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the
bounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and
by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past
night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which
their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these
things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great
bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as
irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so
enslaved them to the race.

They were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them
all; though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and
maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran
into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both
balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the
individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt
and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all
directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did
point to.

The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.  Clinging to a spar with
one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;
others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on
the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready
and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that
infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!

"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been
heard.  "Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts
one odd jet that way, and then disappears."

It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken
some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon
proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope
belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an
orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges
of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,
as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less
than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any
calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic
fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;
but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with
his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus
booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a
mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven
miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of
defiance.

"There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.

"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour
and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at
the fore.  The boats!--stand by!"

Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
from his perch.

"Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare
one, rigged the afternoon previous.  "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is
thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!"

As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the
first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for
the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he
told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull
straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a
certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the
whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and
while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his
eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in
an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a
lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of
the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on
annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But
skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in
the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by
a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore
every other cry but his to shreds.

But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the
three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of
themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in
him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to
rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab
first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking
in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some
snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of
sharks!

Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.
Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically
reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;
dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and
then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the
intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.
That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining
tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the
more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed
them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and
then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,
in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of
punch.

While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out
after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,
while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,
twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and
Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while
the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the
creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness
of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed
drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting
perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad
forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into
the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men
struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.

The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as
he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a
little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and
with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his
flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the
least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly
drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if
satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated
forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled
lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.

As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,
wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all
these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have
befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now
found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a
comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous
day's mishap.

But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;
as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the
shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist
him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp
splinter.

"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who
he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."

"The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up;
"I put good work into that leg."

"But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.

"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even
with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost.  Nor
white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his
own proper and inaccessible being.  Can any lead touch yonder floor,
any mast scrape yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"

"Dead to leeward, sir."

"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest
of the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the
boat's crews."

"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."

"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"

"Sir?"

"My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that
shivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him
yet.  By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."

The old man's hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,
the Parsee was not there.

"The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"

"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"

But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
nowhere to be found.

"Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--I
thought I saw him dragging under."

"MY line! MY line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--What
death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the
belfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see
it?--the forged iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered
fool! this hand did dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!  Keep
him nailed--Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--collect
the oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a
pull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life!
I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight
through it, but I'll slay him yet!

"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck;
"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus' name no more
of this, that's worse than devil's madness.  Two days chased; twice
stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee;
thy evil shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--
what more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous
fish till he swamps the last man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the
bottom of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?
Oh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!"

"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.  But in
this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm
of this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for ever Ahab,
man.  This whole act's immutably decreed.  'Twas rehearsed by thee
and me a billion years before this ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the
Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders.  Look thou, underling! that
thou obeyest mine.--Stand round me, men.  Ye see an old man cut down
to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely
foot.  'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede,
that moves upon a hundred legs.  I feel strained, half stranded, as
ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.  But
ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that
Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.  Believe ye, men, in the things
called omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere they drown,
drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
sink for evermore.  So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow
will be the third.  Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to
spout his last!  D'ye feel brave men, brave?"

"As fearless fire," cried Stubb.

"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: "The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked the
same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly
I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in
mine!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go
before:--but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How's
that?--There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by
the ghosts of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks
my brain.  I'LL, I'LL solve it, though!"

When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.  Meantime, of the
broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another
leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed
within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone
backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.



CHAPTER 135

The Chase.--Third Day.


The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of
the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all.
Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What a
lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a
summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its
throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never
thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT'S tingling enough for
mortal man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and
privilege.  Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;
and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
that.  And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen
calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents
turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair is growing now;
this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that
sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the wild winds blow
it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
tossed ship they cling to.  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere
this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
Out upon it!--it's tainted.  Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on
such a wicked, miserable world.  I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and
slink there.  And yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who
ever conquered it?  In every fight it has the last and bitterest
blow.  Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward
wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a
single blow.  Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than THAT.
Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most
exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but
only bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There's a most special, a
most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!  And yet, I say again,
and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in
the wind.  These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear
heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness;
and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea
may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and
swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal
Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these
Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full
as strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!  What
d'ye see?"

"Nothing, sir."

"Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging!  See the
sun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I've oversailed him.  How, got the
start?  Aye, he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might
have known it, too.  Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing.  Aye,
aye, I have run him by last night.  About! about!  Come down, all of
ye, but the regular look outs!  Man the braces!"

Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the
braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in
her own white wake.

"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck
to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.
"God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the
inside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying
him!"

"Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
"We should meet him soon."

"Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and
once more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.  Time itself now
held long breaths with keen suspense.  But at last, some three points
off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly
from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of
fire had voiced it.

"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!  On
deck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye.  He's
too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!  Stand over
that helmsman with a top-maul!  So, so; he travels fast, and I must
down.  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the
sea; there's time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet somehow so
young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from
the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same!--the same!--the same to Noah
as to me.  There's a soft shower to leeward.  Such lovely
leewardings!  They must lead somewhere--to something else than common
land, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward! the white whale goes that
way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter.  But
good bye, good bye, old mast-head!  What's this?--green? aye, tiny
mosses in these warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on
Ahab's head!  There's the difference now between man's old age and
matter's.  But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our
hulls, though, are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that's all.
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.
I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made of dead trees
outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital
fathers.  What's that he said? he should still go before me, my
pilot; and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at the
bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all
night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.  Aye, aye,
like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O
Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.  Good-bye,
mast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.  We'll
talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,
tied by head and tail."

He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's
stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to
the mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him
pause.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir?"

"For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage,
Starbuck."

"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."

"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
Starbuck!"

"Truth, sir: saddest truth."

"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,
Starbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man."

Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.

"Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's
a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!"

"Lower away!"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.  "Stand
by the crew!"

In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

"The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window
there; "O master, my master, come back!"

But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and
the boat leaped on.

Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,
when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters
beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,
every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the
boat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the
whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently
following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the
banners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first
sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had
been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all
such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to
the senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect
them,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
molesting the others.

"Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou yet ring
boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical
third day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous
intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the
noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing--be that
end what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,
and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a
shudder!  Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and
skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl! thou
fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes
grown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but
clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming?  My legs feel
faint; like his who has footed it all day.  Feel thy heart,--beats
it yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak
aloud!--Mast-head there!  See ye my boy's hand on the
hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--
mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he
pecks--he tears the vane"--pointing to the red flag flying at the
main-truck--"Ha! he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now?
see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"

The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the
mast-heads--a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had
sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on
his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew
maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered
and hammered against the opposing bow.

"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
no hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me!  Ha! ha!"

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound was heard;
a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled
with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot
lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping
veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then
fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the
waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly
sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like
new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.

"Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward
to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded
in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that
fell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his
broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted
together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and
once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from
the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of
their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as
the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank
as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed
round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns
in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions
of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;
his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full
upon old Ahab.

The harpoon dropped from his hand.

"Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee!
I see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is
the hearse that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last
letter of thy word.  Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the
ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and
return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first
thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I
harpoon.  Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey
me.--Where's the whale? gone down again?"

But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with
the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last
encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was
now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the
ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to
him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed
swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing
his own straight path in the sea.

"Oh!  Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,
that madly seekest him!"

Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
to leeward, by both oars and canvas.  And at last when Ahab was
sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's
face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel
about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.
Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly
mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in
the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and
were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through
the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb
and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and
lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken
boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But
he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that
perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and
so nail it to the mast.

Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so
rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start
had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over
the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously
stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that
the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in
the sea, at almost every dip.

"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull
on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water."

"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"

"They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--he
muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
Ahab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.  The helm!
take the helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.

At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled
round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if
sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically
rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in
it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the
elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once
more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the
oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were
therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so
fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and
rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still
afloat and swimming.

Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on
their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the
treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the
empty air!

"What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars!
oars!  Burst in upon him!"

Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale
wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that
evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;
seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking
it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down
upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  "I grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.  Is't night?"

"The whale!  The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.

"Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be
for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his
mark!  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not
save my ship?"

But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two
planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily
disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,
splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring
water.

Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him
as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his
own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon
the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as
soon as he.

"The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers of
air, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
woman's fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long
fidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.
Nay, nay!  Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his
unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he
cannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!"

"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee, thou
grinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but
Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a
mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!
I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.
For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand
the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty
of gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and
jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy and over
salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for
one red cherry ere we die!"

"Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.  Oh, Stubb, I
hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers
will now come to her, for the voyage is up."

From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;
hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained
in their hands, just as they had darted from their various
employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which
from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a
broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he
rushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his
whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid
white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow, till
men and timbers reeled.  Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like
dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their
bull-like necks.  Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as
mountain torrents down a flume.

"The ship!  The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the
boat; "its wood could only be American!"

Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for
a time, he lay quiescent.

"I turn my body from the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
hammer.  Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked
keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,
and Pole-pointed prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish,
and without me?  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
shipwrecked captains?  Oh, lonely death on lonely life!  Oh, now I
feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.  Ho, ho! from all
your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!  Towards
thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last
I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's
sake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins and all hearses
to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to
pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned
whale!  THUS, I give up the spear!"

The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with
igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul.  Ahab
stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him
round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their
victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.
Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out
of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,
disappeared in its depths.

For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned.
"The ship?  Great God, where is the ship?"  Soon they through dim,
bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the
gaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while
fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty
perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking
lookouts on the sea.  And now, concentric circles seized the lone
boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every
lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round
in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.

But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of
the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the
flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the
destroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm
and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act
of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.  A
sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from
its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and
incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its
broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and
simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage
beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the
bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak
thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of
Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to
hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
helmeted herself with it.

Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years
ago.



Epilogue

"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE"
Job.

The drama's done.  Why then here does any one step forth?--Because
one did survive the wreck.

It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom
the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that
bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day
the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped
astern.  So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full
sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me,
I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.  When I
reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.  Round and round, then,
and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis
of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.
Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and
now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its
great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot
lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.  Buoyed
up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a
soft and dirgelike main.  The unharming sharks, they glided by as if
with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with
sheathed beaks.  On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and
picked me up at last.  It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in
her retracing search after her missing children, only found another
orphan.

Introduction: A GUIDE TO 
THE GUIDE 


Some unhelpful remarks from the author 

The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is now so 
complicated that every time I tell it I contradict myself, and whenever 
I do get it right I'm misquoted. So the publication of this omnibus 
edition seemed like a good opportunity to set the record straight - or 
at least firmly crooked. Anything that is put down wrong here is, as far 
as I'm concerned, wrong for good. 

The idea for the title first cropped up while I was lying drunk in a 
field in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1971. Not particularly drunk, just the 
sort of drunk you get when you have a couple of stiff Gossers after 
not having eaten for two days straight, on account of being a 
penniless hitchhiker. We are talking of a mild inability to stand up. 

I was traveling with a copy of the Hitch Hiker s Guide to Europe by 
Ken Walsh, a very battered copy that I had borrowed from someone. 

In fact, since this was 1971 and I still have the book, it must count as 
stolen by now. I didn't have a copy of Europe on Five Dollars a Day (as 
it then was) because I wasn't in that financial league. 

Night was beginning to fall on my field as it spun lazily underneath 
me. I was wondering where I could go that was cheaper than 
Innsbruck, revolved less and didn't do the sort of things to me that 
Innsbruck had done to me that afternoon. What had happened was 
this. I had been walking through the town trying to find a particular 
address, and being thoroughly lost I stopped to ask for directions 
from a man in the street. I knew this mightn't be easy because I don't 
speak German, but I was still surprised to discover just how much 
difficulty I was having communicating with this particular man. 
Gradually the truth dawned on me as we struggled in vain to 
understand each other that of all the people in Innsbruck I could have 
stopped to ask, the one I had picked did not speak English, did not 
speak French and was also deaf and dumb. With a series of sincerely 
apologetic hand movements, I disentangled myself, and a few 



minutes later, on another street, I stopped and asked another man 
who also turned out to be deaf and dumb, which was when I bought 
the beers. 

I ventured back onto the street. I tried again. 

When the third man I spoke to turned out to be deaf and dumb 
and also blind I began to feel a terrible weight settling on my 
shoulders; wherever I looked the trees and buildings took on dark and 
menacing aspects. I pulled my coat tightly around me and hurried 
lurching down the street, whipped by a sudden gusting wind. I 
bumped into someone and stammered an apology, but he was deaf 
and dumb and unable to understand me. The sky loured. The 
pavement seemed to tip and spin. If I hadn't happened then to duck 
down a side street and pass a hotel where a convention for the deaf 
was being held, there is every chance that my mind would have 
cracked completely and I would have spent the rest of my life writing 
the sort of books for which Kafka became famous and dribbling. 

As it is I went to lie in a field, along with my Hitch Hiker's Guide to 
Europe, and when the stars came out it occurred to me that if only 
someone would write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as well, then 
I for one would be off like a shot. Having had this thought I promptly 
fell asleep and forgot about it for six years. 

I went to Cambridge University. I took a number of baths-and a 
degree in English. I worried a lot about girls and what had happened 
to my bike. Later I became a writer and worked on a lot of things that 
were almost incredibly successful but in fact just failed to see the light 
of day. Other writers will know what I mean. 

My pet project was to write something that would combine 
comedy and science fiction, and it was this obsession that drove me 
into deep debt and despair. No one was interested, except finally one 
man a BBC radio producer named Simon Brett who had had the same 
idea, comedy and science fiction. Although Simon only produced the 
first episode before leaving the BBC to concentrate on his own writing 
(he is best known in the United Stares for his excellent Charles Paris 
detective novels), I owe him an immense debt of gratitude for simply 
getting the thing to happen in the first place. He was succeeded by 
the legendary Geoffrey Perkins. 

In its original form the show was going to be rather different. I was 
feeling a little disgruntled with the world at the time and had put 



together about six different plots, each of which ended with the 
destruction of the world in a different way, and for a different reason. 
It was to be called "The Ends of the Earth " 

While I was filling in the details of the first plot - in which the Earth 
was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace express route - I 
realized that I needed to have someone from another planet around 
to tell the reader what was going on, to give the story the context it 
needed. So I had to work out who he was and what he was doing on 
the Earth. 

I decided to call him Ford Prefect. (This was a joke that missed 
American audiences entirely, of course, since they had never heard of 
the rather oddly named little car, and many thought it was a typing 
error for Perfect.) I explained in the text that the minimal research my 
alien character had done before arriving on this planet had led him to 
think that this name would be "nicely inconspicuous." He had simply 
mistaken the dominant life form. 

So how would such a mistake arise? I remembered when I used to 
hitchhike through Europe and would often find that the information 
or advice that came my way was out of date or misleading in some 
way. Most of it, of course, just came from stories of other people's 
travel experiences. 

At that point the title The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
suddenly popped back into my mind from wherever it had been 
hiding all this time. Ford, I decided, would be a researcher who 
collected data for the Guide. As soon as I started to develop this 
particular notion, it moved inexorably to the center of the story, and 
the rest, as the creator of the original Ford Prefect would say, is bunk. 

The story grew in the most convoluted way, as many people will be 
surprised to learn. Writing episodically meant that when I finished 
one episode I had no idea about what the next one would contain. 
When, in the twists and turns of the plot, some event suddenly 
seemed to illuminate things that had gone before, I was as surprised 
as anyone else. 

I think that the BBC's attitude toward the show while it was in 
production was very similar to that which Macbeth had toward 
murdering people - initial doubts, followed by cautious enthusiasm 
and then greater and greater alarm at the sheer scale of the 
undertaking and still no end in sight. Reports that Geoffrey and I and 



the sound engineers were buried in a subterranean studio for weeks 
on end, taking as long to produce a single sound effect as other 
people took to produce an entire series (and stealing everybody else's 
studio time in which to do so), were all vigorously denied but 
absolutely true. 

The budget of the series escalated to the point that it could have 
practically paid for a few seconds of Dallas. If the show hadn't 
worked... 

The first episode went out on BBC Radio 4 at 10 30 P.M. on 
Wednesday, March 8, 1978, in a huge blaze of no publicity at all. Bats 
heard it. The odd dog barked. 

After a couple of weeks a letter or two trickled in. So - someone 
out there had listened. People I Balked to seemed to like Marvin the 
Paranoid Android, whom I had written in as a one - scene joke and 
had only developed further at Geoffrey's insistence. 

Then some publishers became interested, and I was commissioned 
by Pan Books in England to write up the series in book form. After a 
lot of procrastination and hiding and inventing excuses and having 
baths, I managed to get about two-thirds of it done. At this point they 
said, very pleasantly and politely, that I had already passed ten 
deadlines, so would I please just finish the page I was on and let them 
have the damn thing. 

Meanwhile, I was busy trying to write another series and was also 
writing and script editing the TV series "Dr. Who," because while it 
was all very pleasant to have your own radio series, especially one 
that somebody had written in to say they had heard, it didn't exactly 
buy you lunch. 

So that was more or less the situation when the book The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was published in England in 
September 1979 and appeared on the Sunday Times mass market 
best-seller list at number one and just stayed there. Clearly, 
somebody had been listening. 

This is where things start getting complicated, and this is what I 
was asked, in writing this Introduction, to explain. The Guide has 
appeared in so many forms - books, radio, a television series, records 
and soon to be a major motion picture - each time with a different 
story line that even its most acute followers have become baffled at 
times. 



Here then is a breakdown of the different versions - not including 
the various stage versions, which haven't been seen in the States and 
only complicate the matter further. 

The radio series began in England in March 1978. The first series 
consisted of six programs, or "fits" as they were called. Fits 1 thru 6. 
Easy. Later that year, one more episode was recorded and broadcast, 
commonly known as the Christmas episode. It contained no reference 
of any kind to Christmas. It was called the Christmas episode because 
it was first broadcast on December 24, which is not Christmas Day. 
After this, things began to get increasingly complicated. 

In the fall of 1979, the first Hitchhiker book was published in 
England, called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It was a 
substantially expanded version of the first four episodes of the radio 
series, in which some of the characters behaved in entirely different 
ways and others behaved in exactly the same ways but for entirely 
different reasons, which amounts to the same thing but saves 
rewriting the dialogue. 

At roughly the same time a double record album was released, 
which was, by contrast, a slightly contracted version of the first four 
episodes of the radio series. These were not the recordings that were 
originally broadcast but wholly new recordings of substantially the 
same scripts. This was done because we had used music off 
gramophone records as incidental music for the series, which is fine 
on radio, but makes commercial release impossible. 

In January 1980, five new episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy" were broadcast on BBC Radio, all in one week, bringing 
the total number to twelve episodes. 

In the fall of 1980, the second Hitchhiker book was published in 
England, around the same time that Harmony Books published the 
first book in the United States. It was a very substantially reworked, 
reedited and contracted version of episodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, S and 6 
(in that order) of the radio series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy." In case that seemed too straightforward, the book was called 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, because it included the 
material from radio episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy," which was set in a restaurant called Milliways, otherwise 
known as the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. 



At roughly the same time, a second record album was made 
featuring a heavily rewritten and expanded version of episodes 5 and 
6 of the radio series. This record album was also called The Restaurant 
at the End of the Universe. 

Meanwhile, a series of six television episodes of "The Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy" was made by the BBC and broadcast in January 
1981. This was based, more or less, on the first six episodes of the 
radio series. In other words, it incorporated most of the book The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the second half of the book The 
Restaurant at be End of the Universe. Therefore, though it followed 
the basic structure of the radio series, it incorporated revisions from 
the books, which didn't. 

In January 1982 Harmony Books published The Restaurant at the 
End of the Universe in the United States. 

In the summer of 1982, a third Hitchhiker book was published 
simultaneously in England and the United States, called Life, the 
Universe and Everything. This was not based on anything that had 
already been heard or seen on radio or television. In fact it flatly 
contradicted episodes 7, 8, 9,10, I 1 and 12 of the radio series. These 
episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," you will 
remember, had already been incorporated in revised form in the book 
called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. 

At this point I went to America to write a film screenplay which was 
completely inconsistent with most of what has gone on so far, and 
since that film was then delayed in the making (a rumor currently has 
it that filming will start shortly before the Last Trump), I wrote a 
fourth and last book in the trilogy, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. 
This was published in Britain and the USA in the fall of 1984 and it 
effectively contradicted everything to date, up to and including itself. 

As if this all were not enough I wrote a computer game for Infocom 
called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which bore only fleeting 
resemblances to anything that had previously gone under that title, 
and in collaboration with Geoffrey Perkins assembled The Hitchhiker s 
Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts (published in England 
and the USA in 1985). Now this was an interesting venture. The book 
is, as the title suggests, a collection of all the radio scripts, as 
broadcast, and it is therefore the only example of one Hitchhiker 
publication accurately and consistently reflecting another. I feel a 



little uncomfortable with this - which is why the introduction to that 
book was written after the final and definitive one you are now 
reading and, of course, flatly contradicts it. 

People often ask me how they can leave the planet, so I have 
prepared some brief notes. 

How to Leave the Planet 

1. Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that 
it's very important that you get away as soon as possible. 

2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the 
White House-(202) 456-1414-to have a word on your behalf with the 
guys at NASA. 

3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the 
Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They 
don't have any friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but 
they do seem to have a little influence, so you may as well try. 

4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone 
number is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible. 

5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and 
explain that de's vitally important you get away before your phone bill 
arrives.

THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO 

THE GALAXY 


For Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst 
and all other Arlingtonians 
for tea, sympathy, and a sofa 



Preface 


Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of 
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow 
sun. 

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an 
utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life 
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches 
are a pretty neat idea. 

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most 
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many 
solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were 
largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, 
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of 
paper that were unhappy. 

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and 
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big 
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some 
said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should 
ever have left the oceans. 

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man 
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice 
to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in 
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going 
wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be 
made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, 
and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 

Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone 
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost 
forever. 

This is not her story. 



But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its 
consequences. 

It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until 
the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any 
Earthman. 

Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. 

In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out 
of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman 
had ever heard either. 

Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful 
one - more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better 
selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more 
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical 
blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest 
Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? 

In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim 
of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the 
great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all 
knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and 
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it 
scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important 
respects. 

First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T 
PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. 

But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its 
extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these 
consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book 
begins very simply. 

It begins with a house. 



Chapter 1 


The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It 
stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country 
farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty 
years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows 
set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly 
failed to please the eye. 

The only person for whom the house was in any way special was 
Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he 
lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had 
moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He 
was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with 
himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that 
people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. 
He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a 
lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of 
his friends worked in advertising. 

It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to 
knock down his house and build an bypass instead. 

At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. 
He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, 
opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped 
off to the bathroom to wash. 

Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub. 

Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a 
moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom 
window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He 
shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to 
find something pleasant to put in his mouth. 

Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. 

The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in 
search of something to connect with. 



The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. 

He stared at it. 

"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get 
dressed. 

Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, 
and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he 
hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that 
he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," 
he thought and stomped on to the bedroom. 

He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He 
vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that 
seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people 
about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual 
recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces. Something 
about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the 
pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. 
Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd 
decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to 
stand on. It would sort itself out. 

God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked 
at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," 
he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of 
something to connect with. 

Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a 
big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. 

Mr. L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was 
a carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specifically he 
was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously 
enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line 
descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and 
racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible 
Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L Prosser 
of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the turn 
and a predilection for little fur hats. 

He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous 
worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because 



something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which was to see 
that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day 
was out. 

"Come off it, Mr. Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You 
can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried to make his 
eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it. 

Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. 

"I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first." 

"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr. Prosser 
gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, "this 
bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!" 

"First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?" 

Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put 
it away again. 

"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. 
You've got to build bypasses." 

Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point 
A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A 
very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, 
are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many 
people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about 
point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They 
often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the 
hell they wanted to be. 

Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in 
particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from 
points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with 
axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, 
which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted 
climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why - he just 
liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer 
drivers. 

He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally 
uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly 
incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him. 

Mr. Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions 
or protests at the appropriate time you know." 



"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I 
knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I 
asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd 
come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. 
Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. 
Then he told me." 

"But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning 
office for the last nine month." 

"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, 
yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call 
attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or 
anything." 

"But the plans were on display..." 

"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find 
them." 

"That's the display department." 

"With a torch." 

"Ah, well the lights had probably gone." 

"So had the stairs." 

"But look, you found the notice didn't you?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a 
locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the 
door saying Beware of the Leopard." 

A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he 
lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over 
Arthur Dent's house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. 

"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said. 

"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it." 

"You'll like the bypass." 

"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take 
your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on and 
you know it." 

Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his 
mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive 
visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur 
himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three 



hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often 
bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. 
He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. 

"Mr. Dent," he said. 

"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 

"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much 
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over 
you?" 

"How much?" said Arthur. 

"None at all," said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously off 
wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen 
all shouting at him. 

By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion 
the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends 
was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in 
the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually 
claimed. 

Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. 

This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth 
years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth 
society - with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had 
spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which 
was plausible enough. 

He had made one careless blunder though, because he had 
skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had 
gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being 
nicely inconspicuous. 

He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not 
conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed 
backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards 
from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but 
it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't 
blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time 
your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was 
that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving 
impression that he was about to go for their neck. 



He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, 
but a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For 
instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk 
and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got 
thrown out. 

Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and 
stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he 
was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. 

"Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone 
would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking 
for. 

"Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a 
moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an 
enormous round of drinks. 

Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his 
skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her 
in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't 
matter that much really. 

Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he 
would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to 
Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't 
you think it's about time you went off home sir?" 

"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on 
these occasions. 

In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared 
distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all. The 
reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery 
of the Betelgeuse trading scouts. 

Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would 
arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded 
anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth. 

Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he 
knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He 
knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty 
Altairan dollars a day. 

In fact. Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly 
remarkable book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 



Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the 
environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It was 
Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional 
demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr. 
Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy 
such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the 
They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back 
talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer 
drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting 
with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to 
their financial advantage. 

The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. 

The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in. 

A shadow moved across him again. 

"Hello Arthur," said the shadow. 

Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see 
Ford Prefect standing above him. 

"Ford! Hello, how are you?" 

"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?" 

"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these 
bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house 
down if I don't, but other than that... well, no not especially, why?" 

They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often 
failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good, is 
there anywhere we can talk?" 

"What?" said Arthur Dent. 

For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly 
into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly 
he squatted down beside Arthur. 

"We've got to talk," he said urgently. 

"Fine," said Arthur, "talk." 

"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. 
Now. We'll go to the pub in the village." 

He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. 



"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at 
Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!" 

Ford glanced at him, puzzled. 

"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked. 

"But I don't want him to!" 

"Ah." 

"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur. 

"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me - I've got to tell you 
the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell you now, 
and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom." 

"But why?" 

"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink." 

Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his 
will was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was because 
of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace 
ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of 
Orion Beta. 

The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, 
and was played like this: 

Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in 
front of each of them. 

Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as 
immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh don't give me 
none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more 
of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my 
eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful 
Old Janx Spirit"). 

Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on 
the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his 
opponent - who would then have to drink it. 

The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. 
And again. 

Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because 
one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power. 



As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final 
loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely 
biological. 

Ford Prefect usually played to lose. 


Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want 
to go to the Florse and Groom after all. 

"But what about my house...?" he asked plaintively. 

Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought 
struck him. 

"Fie wants to knock your house down?" 

"Yes, he wants to build..." 

"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?" 

"Yes, and..." 

"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse 
me!" he shouted. 

Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer 
drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health 
hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. 
Fie was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had 
company. 

"Yes? Flello?" he called. "Flas Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?" 

"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?" 

"Well?" sighed Mr. Prosser. 

"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be staying 
here all day?" 

"So?" 

"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing 
nothing?" 

"Could be, could be..." 

"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually 
need him to lie here all the time do you?" 

"What?" 


"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here." 



Mr. Prosser thought about this. 

"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need..." Prosser was 
worried. He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense. 

Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that he's 
actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an 
hour. How does that sound?" 

Mr. Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. 

"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone of 
voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure. 

"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on," said 
Ford, "we can always cover up for you in return." 

"Thank you very much," said Mr. Prosser who no longer knew how 
to play this at all, "thank you very much, yes, that's very kind..." He 
frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped 
hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He 
could only assume that he had just won. 

"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come over 
here and lie down..." 

"What?" said Mr. Prosser. 

"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. 
Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't they? Or there 
won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr. Dent's house will 
there?" 

"What?" said Mr. Prosser again. 

"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr. Dent, says that he will 
stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and 
take over from him." 

"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him 
with his shoe to be quiet. 

"You want me," said Mr. Prosser, spelling out this new thought to 
himself, "to come and lie there..." 

"Yes." 

"In front of the bulldozer?" 

"Yes." 

"Instead of Mr. Dent." 

"Yes." 



"In the mud." 

"In, as you say it, the mud." 

As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser 
after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was 
more like the world as he knew it. He sighed. 

"In return for which you will take Mr. Dent with you down to the 
pub?" 

"That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly." 

Mr. Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. 

"Promise?" 

"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur. 

"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down." 

Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream. 

Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the 
mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he 
sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying 
it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed 
into his shoes. 

Ford looked at him severely. 

"And no sneaky knocking down Mr. Dent's house whilst he's away, 
alright?" he said. 

"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to 
speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest 
possibility of crossing my mind." 

He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching 
and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to 
marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a 
mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this - his 
mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of 
blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, 
and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high 
dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with 
rage, but Mr. Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He 
began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids. Bureaucratic 
cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers 
handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of 
horsemen laughing at him in his head - what a day. 



What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of 
dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now. 
Arthur remained very worried. 

"But can we trust him?" he said. 

"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?" 

"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink." 



Chapter 2 


Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It 
says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the 
fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain 
carbon-based life forms. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says 
that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. 

It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having 
your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large 
gold brick. 

The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic 
Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one 
and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate 
afterwards. 

The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. 

Take the juice from one bottle of that 01' Janx Spirit, it says. 

Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V - 
Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!! 

Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it 
must be properly iced or the benzine is lost). 

Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in 
memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the 
Marshes of Fallia. 

Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin 
Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark 
Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. 

Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, 
spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the 
drink. 

Sprinkle Zamphuor. 

Add an olive. 



Drink... but... very carefully... 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the 
Encyclopedia Galactica. 

"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse 
and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end." 

The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of 
treatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up his 
nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of 
the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged 
helplessly and said nothing. 

So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and started 
pulling pints. 

He tried again. 

"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?" 

Ford glanced round at him. 

"No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window. 

"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the 
barman. "Arsenal without a chance?" 

"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end." 

"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his glasses 
this time at Arthur. "Lucky escape for Arsenal if it did." 

Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. 

"No, not really," he said. He frowned. 

The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints," he 
said. 

Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and 
smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard 
what was going on. 

None of them had, and none of them could understand what he 
was smiling at them for. 

A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked 
at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an 
answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them. 

"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that would 
have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing. 



Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the 
change." 

"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir." 

"You've got ten minutes left to spend it." 

The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit. 

"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is 
going on?" 

"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through." 

"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?" 

The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored 
him. He said, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." 

"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the Reader's 
Digest. They've got a page for people like you." 

"Drink up." 

"Why three pints all of a sudden?" 

"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it." 

"Muscle relaxant?" 

"Muscle relaxant." 

Arthur stared into his beer. 

"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always 
been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?" 

"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we known 
each other?" 

"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he 
said. "Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time." 

"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not 
from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the 
vicinity of Betelgeuse?" 

Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way. 

"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why - do you think 
it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?" 

Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what 
with the world being about to end. He just said: 

"Drink up." 

He added, perfectly factually: 



"The world's about to end." 

Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the 
pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and 
mind his own business. 

"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low 
over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays." 



Chapter 3 


On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through 
the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several 
somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike 
somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds. They soared with 
ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their 
time, grouping, preparing. 

The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their 
presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The 
huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed 
over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank 
looked straight through them - which was a pity because it was 
exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years. 

The only place they registered at all was on a small black device 
called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It 
nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect 
wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel 
were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth 
physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed 
them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended 
he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha Sens- 
O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat 
black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at 
one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish 
electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons 
and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million 
"pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely 
complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic 
cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large 
friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that 
most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing 
corporations of Ursa Minor - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson 



electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, 
an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large 
buildings to carry it around in. 

Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, 
and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the 
subject of towels. 

A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an 
interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - 
you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold 
moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded 
beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can 
sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert 
world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river 
Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your 
head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous 
Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes 
that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very 
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress 
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean 
enough. 

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For 
some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch 
hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is 
also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, 
flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, 
space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the 
hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker 
might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any 
man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, 
slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows 
where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with. 

Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, 
you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows 
where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; 
hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) 



Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the 
surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At 
Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of 
tea. 

"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur. 

Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. 

"Why? What, no... should I have?" Fie had given up being surprised, 
there didn't seem to be any point any longer. 

Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. 

"Drink up," he urged. 

At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside 
filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the 
jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over 
the whisky Ford had eventually bought him. 

Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet. 

"What's that?" he yelped. 

"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet." 

"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed. 

"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, 
drowning his last pint. 

"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur 
looked wildly around him and ran to the window. 

"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell 
am I doing in the pub, Ford?" 

"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let them 
have their fun." 

"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" Fie quickly checked out of the window 
again that they were talking about the same thing. 

"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously 
waving a nearly empty beer glass. Fie made no friends at all in the pub 
that lunchtime. 

"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half 
crazed Visigoths, stop will you!" 



Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he 
asked for four packets of peanuts. 

"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the 
bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so kind." 

Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another five-pound note 
and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then 
looked at Ford. Fie suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary 
sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had 
ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life form 
that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This signal simply 
communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that 
being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be 
further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really 
isn't very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford 
Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 
light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse. 

The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, 
incomprehensible sense of distance. Fie didn't know what it meant, 
but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost 
awe. 

"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the 
effect of silencing the pub. "You think the world's going to end?" 

"Yes," said Ford. 

"But, this afternoon?" 

Ford had recovered himself. Fie was at his flippest. 

"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would estimate." 

The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but 
he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either. 

"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said. 

"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets. 

Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how 
stupid everyone had become. 

The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. Flis eyes 
waved their way up to Ford. 

"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were 
meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something." 



"If you like, yes," said Ford. 

"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his eyes 
began the long trek back down to his whisky. 

"Will that help?" asked the barman. 

"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he said, 
"I've got to go." With a wave, he left. 

The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly 
enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had 
dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly 
over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great 
satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would 
suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon 
monoxide. Flowever, when the moment came she would be too busy 
evaporating herself to notice it. 

The barman cleared his throat. Fie heard himself say: 

"Last orders, please." 

The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move 
faster. 

Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it. 

Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. Fie 
didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the 
wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. Fie didn't 
notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble 
that had been his home. 

"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every penny it's 
got! I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And 
boiled... until... until... until you've had enough." 

Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast. 

"And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've finished I 
will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!" 

Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; 
he didn't notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. 
What Mr. Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were 
screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. 



"And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still running, 
"until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to 
do, and then..." 

Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. 
At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot 
upwards. 

"What the hell's that?" he shrieked. 

Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore 
the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the 
distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that 
drove your ears six feet into your skull. 

Another one followed and did the same thing only louder. 

It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the 
planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they 
were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense - running into 
houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All 
around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into 
each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal 
wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten 
everything it hit. 

Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible 
sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly 
what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O- 
Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and 
woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years, 
but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his 
small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. 

Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a 
big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the 
Vogons. 

Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed 
through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away 
a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw 
away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going. 
Everything was ready, everything was prepared. 

He knew where his towel was. 



A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the 
noise. For a while nothing happened. 

The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on 
Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a 
blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as 
their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships 
hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. 

And still nothing happened. 

Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of 
open ambient sound. Every hi-fi set in the world, every radio, every 
television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, 
every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on. 

Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine 
glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically 
perfect sounding board. 

Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very 
ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system 
ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a 
simple message. 

"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was 
wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion 
levels so low as to make a brave man weep. 

"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning 
Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be aware, the 
plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require 
the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, 
and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. 
The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. 
Thank you." 

The PA died away. 

Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. 
The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were 
iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath 
them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was 
nowhere to flee to. 

Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said: 



"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning 
charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local 
planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, 
so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far 
too late to start making a fuss about it now." 

The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The 
huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the 
underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space. 

By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio 
transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to 
the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard 
what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into 
life again. The voice was annoyed. It said: 

"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For 
heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm 
sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs 
that's your own lookout. 

"Energize the demolition beams." 

Light poured out into the hatchways. 

"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody planet. 
I've no sympathy at all." It cut off. 

There was a terrible ghastly silence. 

There was a terrible ghastly noise. 

There was a terrible ghastly silence. 

The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void. 



Chapter 4 


Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred 
thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President 
of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of 
Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the 
Damogran sun. 

Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost 
totally unheard of. 

Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on 
across the water. It would be some time before it reached its 
destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged 
planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands 
separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. 

The boat sped on. 

Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always 
remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic 
Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because 
it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret. 

The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay 
between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on 
the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny 
spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless 
coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light 
brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless 
coincidence was called France. 

One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole 
string of pretty meaningless coincidences. 

But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of 
culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the 
Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was 
also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the 
sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a 



decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the 
Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod 
Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof 
that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. 

Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? 
quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal 
relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. 

President? 

No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least. 

Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on 
which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod 
Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was 
more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodderl. 

What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was 
doing it. 

He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. 

Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize 
what Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's 
Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, 
but that was just another meaningless coincidence. 

As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled 
quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to 
be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He 
steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right 
one to help improve his ski-boxing. 

"Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his 
nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle. 

The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across 
the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not 
so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the 
sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by 
the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost 
entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly 
down five miles to the opposite shore. 

On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. 



It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had 
built the Heart of Gold - mostly humanoid, but here and there were a 
few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like 
maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a 
Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue). 
All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored 
ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted 
into a free standing prism for the occasion. 

There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of 
them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the 
furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of 
matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and 
impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to 
meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was 
what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even 
have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly how 
much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic 
President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from 
it. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. 

The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the 
Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It 
flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding 
turns. 

In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was 
supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for effect it 
was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. 
They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes 
into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the 
boat's wake as it careered across the bay. 

Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at. 

He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild 
scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the 
rocking waves. 

Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at 
over three billion people. The three billion people weren't actually 
there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small 



robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The 
antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that's 
what they were for. 

He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but 
today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. 

The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of 
his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in 
appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled 
hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with 
something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost 
always unshaven. 

A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, 
rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a 
wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more 
the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, 
steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as 
anything. 

Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the 
sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third 
brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he 
put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. 

Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The 
bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, 
up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the 
jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea 
hundreds of feet below. 

Zaphod smiled, picturing himself. 

A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly 
beautiful one. 

At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on 
to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and 
riddled to a halt. 

To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the 
bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. 

The President of the Galaxy had arrived. 

He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in 
greeting. 



"Hi," he said. 

A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a 
copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of 
the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the 
Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two 
had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had 
already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest 
which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of paper and 
it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break 
out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion 
of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he 
gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. 

"Hi," he said again. 

Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled 
out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked 
up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was 
slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, 
an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red 
head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky 
brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had 
ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased 
to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred 
thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in 
particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him 
rather a lot and told him what she thought of him. 

"Hi honey," he said to her. 

She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she 
looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly - but by this time 
he was looking at something else. 

"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were 
standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with 
the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a 
few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. 

The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of 
the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was 
clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had 
been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote 



control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome 
that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and 
slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although 
they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they 
had built it that way. 

Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty 
metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and 
mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold 
box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever 
conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of 
the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named - The Heart 
of Gold. 

"Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't 
much else he could say. 

He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. 

"Wow." 

The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He 
winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at 
him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible 
showoff. 

"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That 
is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it." 

A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The 
crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched 
buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned. 

As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the 
small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. 

Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, 
let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground 
and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles. 



Chapter 5 


Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other 
Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy 
forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to 
play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and 
waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up 
to a thousand feet with no ill effects. 

Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule 
would not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years 
ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval 
seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's 
virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had 
shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution 
had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in 
disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. 

They never evolved again; they should never have survived. 

The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed 
slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? they said to 
themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them 
they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify 
the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. 

Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been 
working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought 
forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, 
smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with 
breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and 
burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken 
coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They 
were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, 
but the Vogons sat on them anyway. 

Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia 
until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar 
travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to 



the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now 
formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service. 
They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to 
acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon 
is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import 
twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their 
native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them 
to bits with iron mallets. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was 
thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers. 

Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The 
owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and 
was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect2. 

He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange 
monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, 
but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. 

The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant 
bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering 
staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they 
keep themselves very much to themselves. 

This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, 
which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the 
Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see 
was an annoyed Vogon. 

It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect 
was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. 

He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy 
shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match out, 
reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. 
He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. 

Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts." 

Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently. 

"Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've 
never been through a matter transference beam before you've 



probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have 
cushioned your system a bit." 

"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. 

"It's dark," he said. 

"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark." 

"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light." 

One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to 
understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating 
and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or 
Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you 
alright? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange 
behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he 
thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' 
consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of 
a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their 
brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as 
being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings 
after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the 
terrible number of things they didn't know about. 

"Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to some 
peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked. 

"Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing 
out." 

Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. 

"If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly, "would 
I regret it?" 

Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said. 

"Oh good," said Arthur. 

"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the spaceships 
of the Vogon Constructor Fleet." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the word 
safe that I wasn't previously aware of." 

Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. 
Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his 
feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes 
seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells 



which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low 
irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. 

"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly. 

"We hitched a lift," said Ford. 

"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just 
stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his 
head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the 
Basingstoke roundabout?" 

"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling 
device, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away, but 
otherwise, that's more or less right." 

"And the bug-eyed monster?" 

"Is green, yes." 

"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?" 

"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. 

"Shade your eyes..." he said, and turned it on. 

Even Ford was surprised. 

"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying 
saucer?" 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the 
control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing 
populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him 
that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. 
He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope 
that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry 
about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. 

"Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the 
bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling 
rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered 
the report they'd just received. The report was an official release 
which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this 
moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran 
which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes 
unnecessary. 



Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't 
shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the 
Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. 

A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch 
tray. It was grinning like a maniac. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a 
Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going 
on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about. 

Ford and Arthur stared about them. 

"Well, what do you think?" said Ford. 

"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?" 

Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and 
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the 
cramped cabin. 

"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are the 
Dentrassi sleeping quarters." 

"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something." 

"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the 
cooks, they let us on board." 

"I'm confused," said Arthur. 

"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the 
mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the 
mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little 
to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of 
Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being 
put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. 

Ford handed the book to Arthur. 

"What is it?" asked Arthur. 

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. 
It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its 
job." 

Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. 

"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or 
intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day." 



"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur 
who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it 
out of its cover. 

"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving 
you the index." 

A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to 
flicker across the surface. 

"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His 
fingers tapped some more keys. "And there we are." 

The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the 
screen. 

Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and 
words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began 
to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what 
the book said. 

"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a 
lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races 
in the Galaxy - not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, 
officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their 
own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal 
without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, 
found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft 
peat and recycled as firelighters." 

"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger 
down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his 
grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal." 

"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you." 

Arthur blinked at it. 

"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?" 

"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book 
back into its cover. "I'm doing the field research for the New Revised 
Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how 
the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather 
useful little loophole." 

A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the 
Dentrassi?" he said. 



"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best drink 
mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else. And they'll 
always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, 
but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of 
thing you need to know if you're an impoverished hitch hiker trying to 
see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altai ran Dollars a 
day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?" 

Arthur looked lost. 

"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses. 

"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I 
intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen 
years." 

"But how did you get there in the first place then?" 

"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser." 

"A teaser?" 

"Yeah." 

"Er, what is..." 

"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They 
cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar 
contact yet and buzz them." 

"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making 
life difficult for him. 

"Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot 
with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul 
whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in 
front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep 
beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back on the mattress 
with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with 
himself. 

"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a silly 
question, but what am I doing here?" 

"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth." 

"And what's happened to the Earth?" 

"Ah. It's been demolished." 

"Flas it," said Arthur levelly. 

"Yes. It just boiled away into space." 



"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that." 

Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his 
mind. 

"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last. 

"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!" 

Ford sprang up. 

"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently. 

"What?" 

"Don't Panic." 

"I'm not panicking!" 

"Yes you are." 

"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?" 

"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a 
fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear." 

"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought. 

Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small 
yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. Fie wished 
there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. 
Fie would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the 
piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse 
holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had 
been able to see just a small packet of corn flakes. Fie couldn't, and he 
didn't feel safe. 

Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he 
could identify. Fie gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying 
to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. 

"Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important." 

"Im... important?" 

"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy." 

"You mean that's how the Vogons talk?" 

"Listen!" 

"But I can't speak Vogon!" 

"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear." 

Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, 
and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep 



into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a 
second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He 
was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two 
black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white 
candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper 
which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that 
your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of 
glasses. 

He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only 
now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward 
English. 

This is what he heard... 



Chapter 6 


"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle 
howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh 
should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain 
speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention. First of all 
I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers 
aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear 
that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am 
today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply 
so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate 
freeloaders. I have sent out a search party, and as soon that they find 
you I will put you off the ship. If you're very lucky I might read you 
some of my poetry first." 

"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to 
Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy-two hour 
refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all 
planet leave is cancelled. I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I 
don't see why anybody else should have a good time. Message ends." 

The noise stopped. 

Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled 
up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. 
He smiled weakly. 

"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid 
her to marry one..." 

"You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex appeal 
as a road accident. No, don't move," he added as Arthur began to 
uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump into 
hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk." 

"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" 

"You ask a glass of water." 

Arthur thought about this. 

"Ford," he said. 



"Yeah?" 

"What's this fish doing in my ear?" 

"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if 
you like." 

He tossed over The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then 
curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump. 

At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind. 

His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of 
his head. 

The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of 
existence and left him sliding into his own navel. 

They were passing through hyperspace. 

"The Babel fish," said The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, 
"is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the 
Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from 
those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from 
this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the 
mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the 
conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the 
speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical 
upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can 
instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. 

The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix 
which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish." 

"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so 
mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some 
thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the 
non-existence of God." 

"The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I 
exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am 
nothing.'" 

"'But,' says Man, 'The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could 
not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by 
your own arguments, you don't. QED.'" 

"'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly 
vanished in a puff of logic." 



"'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove 
that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing." 

"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of 
dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small 
fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book 
Well That About Wraps It Up For God." 

"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all 
barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has 
caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of 
creation." 

Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the 
kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light years 
from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed. 

The Earth. 

Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There 
was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth 
having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that 
his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the 
people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a 
complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the 
supermarket before and felt a sudden stab - the supermarket was 
gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson's Column had gone! Nelson's 
Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was 
no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only 
existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind - his mind, stuck 
here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of 
claustrophobia closed in on him. 

England no longer existed. He'd got that - somehow he'd got it. He 
tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp it. He 
decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He'd 
never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, 
had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been 
wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. 
McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a 
McDonald's hamburger. 

He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he 
was sobbing for his mother. 

He jerked himself violently to his feet. 



"Ford!" 

Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to 
himself. Fie always found the actual travelling-through-space part of 
space travel rather trying. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, 
you must have been gathering material on it." 

"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes." 

"Let me see what it says in this edition then. I've got to see it." 

"Yeah OK." FHe passed it over again. 

Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. FHe 
pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and 
swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. 

"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out. 

Ford looked over his shoulder. 

"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the screen, 
just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of 
Eroticon 6." 

Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a 
moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up. 

"What? Flarmless? Is that all it's got to say? Flarmless! One word!" 

Ford shrugged. 

"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a 
limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors," he said, "and 
no one knew much about the Earth of course." 

"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit." 

"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. 

FHe had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement." 

"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. 

"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed 
cough. 

"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur. 

"What was that noise?" hissed Ford. 

"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur. 

"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble." 



"You think we're in trouble!" 

Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet. 

"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur. 

"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford. 

There was a sharp ringing rap on the door. 

"Then who is it?" said Arthur. 

"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw 
us in to space." 

"And if we're unlucky?" 

"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious 
in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first..." 



Chapter 7 


Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe. 

The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation 
by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode To A 
Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer 
Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and 
the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by 
gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been 
"disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on 
a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime 
Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save 
life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled 
his brain. 

The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula 
Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the 
destruction of the planet Earth. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so 
much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence 
of muscle movements. Fie had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his 
prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little 
callousness. 

The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs - strapped in. 
Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were 
generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part 
of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved 
and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was 
sheer bloodymindedness. 

The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round 
the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a 
battery of electronic equipment - imagery intensifiers, rhythmic 
modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers - all designed 



to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a 
single nuance of the poet's thought was lost. 

Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, 
but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far 
and didn't think things were likely to change. 

The Vogon began to read - a fetid little passage of his own devising. 

"Oh frettled gruntbuggly..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's body 
- this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for. 

"?... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a 
lurgid bee." 

"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head 
back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside 
him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. 

"Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my 
foonting turlingdromes." 

His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. 
"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, | Or I will 
rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I 
don't!" 

"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford 
Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of 
the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. 

Arthur lolled. 

"Now Earthlings..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford 
Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, 
and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you with a simple choice! 
Either die in the vacuum of space, or..." he paused for melodramatic 
effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!" 

He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat 
and watched them. He did the smile again. 

Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his 
parched mouth and moaned. 

Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it." 

Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite 
simply not occurred to him. 



The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his 
nose and was therefore no bad thing. 

"Oh good..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical 
imagery was really particularly effective." 

Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts 
around this totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to 
bareface their way out of this? 

"Yes, do continue..." invited the Vogon. 

"Oh... and er... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued Arthur, 
"which seemed to counterpoint the... er... er..." He floundered. 

Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism 
of the underlying metaphor of the... er..." He floundered too, but 
Arthur was ready again. 

"... humanity of the..." 

"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him. 

"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul," Arthur 
felt he was on a home stretch now, "which contrives through the 
medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and 
come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other," (he 
was reaching a triumphant crescendo...) "and one is left with a 
profound and vivid insight into... into... er..." (... which suddenly gave 
out on him.) Ford leaped in with the coup de grace: 

"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the 
corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good." 

The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul 
had been touched, but he thought no - too little too late. His voice 
took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. 

"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath 
my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved," he 
said. He paused. "Is that right?" 

Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't 
we all, deep down, you know... er..." 

The Vogon stood up. 

"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry to 
throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I'm going 



to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to 
number three airlock and throw them out!" 

"What?" shouted Ford. 

A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out 
of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. 

"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to write 
a book." 

"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It 
was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard 
Corps. 

The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned 
away. 

Arthur stared round him wildly. 

"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I 
don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross and 
wouldn't enjoy it!" 

The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing 
deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both protesting 
out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own 
again. Fie hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his 
notebook of verses. 

"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying 
metaphor..." Fie considered this for a moment, and then closed the 
book with a grim smile. 

"Death's too good for them," he said. 

The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the 
two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits. 

"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let go of me 
you brute!" 

The Vogon guard dragged them on. 

"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." Fie didn't 
sound hopeful. 

"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard. 

"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "Flow can anyone 
maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying things like that?" 



"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive 
mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished 
today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, 
do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It's now just after four in the 
afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light 
years from the smoking remains of the Earth!" He spluttered and 
gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. 

"Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking." 

"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still 
just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation 
and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking." 

"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried desperately 
to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. 

"Resistance is useless!" 

"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford. 

"Resistance is useless!" 

"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking 
straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him. 

"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly. 

The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped 
slowly over his face. 

"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?" 

"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying life? 
Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships..." 

The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows 
almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said, 

"Well the hours are good..." 

"They'd have to be," agreed Ford. 

Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford. 

"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper. 

"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?" he 
said. "So the hours are pretty good then?" he resumed. 

The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around 
in the murky depths. 

"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the 
actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except..." he thought again, which 



required looking at the ceiling - "except some of the shouting I quite 
like." He filled his lungs and bellowed, "Resistance is..." 

"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I can 
tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said, slowly giving the words time to 
reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The 
leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms 
with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?" 

"Er..." said the guard, "er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it 
really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a 
young Vogon - you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, 
the mindless tedium..." 

"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone reaching 
the conclusion of his argument, "you think you've got problems." 

Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business 
with his home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already 
and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much. 

"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor 
lad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people off 
spaceships..." 

"And shouting," added the guard. 

"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped 
round his neck in friendly condescension,"... and he doesn't even 
know why he's doing it!" 

Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble 
gesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak. 

Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. 

"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose..." 

"Good lad!" encouraged Ford. 

"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the alternative?" 

"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course! Tell 
them," he went on, "you're not going to do it anymore." He felt he 
had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed 
to have his mind occupied pondering that much. 

"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." said the guard, 
"erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me." 

Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. 



"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see, there's 
more to it than that you see..." 

But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his 
original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was 
obviously quite touched. 

"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you 
both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other 
bits of shouting I've got to do." 

It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all. 

"Come on now... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly. 

"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn..." said Arthur without any clear 
inflection. 

"But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to 
tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!" 

"Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You 
see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting 
Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and 
non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I 
know." 

They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel hatchway 
of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The 
guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open. 

"But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye 
now." He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small 
chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round 
and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. 

"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you 
don't know anything about... here how about this?" Desperately he 
grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand - he hummed the 
first bar of Beethoven's Fifth. 

"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?" 

"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my aunt." 

If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway 
sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of 
the ship's engines. 

They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet 
in diameter and ten feet long. 



"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against the 
curved wall. 

Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. 
He didn't look up. He just lay panting. 

"We're trapped now aren't we?" 

"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped." 

"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were 
going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and 
didn't notice." 

"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up 
expectantly. 

"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on 
the other side of this airtight hatchway." He kicked the hatch they'd 
just been through. 

"But it was a good idea was it?" 

"Oh yes, very neat." 

"What was it?" 

"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is 
there?" 

"So... er, what happens next?" 

"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in 
a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and 
asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to 
thirty seconds of course..." said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his 
back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian 
battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien. 

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 

"Yes," said Ford, "except... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly lunged 
across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. 
"What's this switch?" he cried. 

"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round. 

"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all." 

He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from 
where he left off. 

"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in 
a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of 



asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my 
mother told me when I was young." 

"Why, what did she tell you?" 

"I don't know, I didn't listen." 

"Oh." Ford carried on humming. 

"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column has 
gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the words 
Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly 
Harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well." 

A motor whirred. 

A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer 
hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny 
impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer 
space like corks from a toy gun. 



Chapter 8 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It 
has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and 
under many different editorships. It contains contributions from 
countless numbers of travellers and researchers. 

The introduction begins like this: 

"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly 
hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way 
down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. 
Listen..." and so on. 

(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you 
things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously 
beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative 
erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance 
between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on 
the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you 
leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get 
a receipt.) 

To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of 
distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible 
for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to 
consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in 
Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts. 

The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the 
human imagination. 

Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands 
of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between 
the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where 
the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest 
stellar neighbour. Alpha Proxima. 



For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach 
Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand 
years. 

The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but 
you don't get to see much on the way. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful 
of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty 
seconds. However it goes on to say that what with space being the 
mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another 
ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred 
and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against. 

By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone 
number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good 
party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with - 
she went off with a gatecrasher. 

Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have 
all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in 
some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds 
later Ford and Arthur were rescued. 



Chapter 9 


A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open 
and close itself for no apparent reason. 

This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch. 

A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth 
of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of 
million light years from end to end. 

As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it 
and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-foot-high 
market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly 
of surprise. 

Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of 
it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine - struck 
land of Poghril in the Pansel system. 

The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one 
last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. 

The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated 
backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. 
Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small 
random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space 
and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely 
patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was 
part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to 
cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was 
how life began in the Universe. 

Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason 
and spewed up a pavement. 

On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like 
half-spent fish. 

"There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the 
pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, "I told 
you I'd think of something." 



"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure." 

"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship and 
get rescued by it." 

The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various 
pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light 
exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time 
blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced 
quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. 

"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were 
astronomical." 

"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford. 

"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of eternity 
yawned beneath them. 

"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet." 

"No, nor have I," said Arthur. 

The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several 
unexpected directions. 

Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in 
considerable surprise. 

"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at 
Southend." 

"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford. 

"Why?" 

"Because I thought I must be going mad." 

"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it." 

Ford thought about this. 

"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked. 

"I think so," said Arthur. 

"Well, perhaps we're both going mad." 

"Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this 
was Southend." 

"Well, do you think this is Southend?" 

"Oh yes." 

"So do I." 

"Therefore we must be mad." 



"Nice day for it." 

"Yes," said a passing maniac. 

"Who was that?" asked Arthur 

"Who - the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of 
kippers?" 

"Yes." 

"I don't know. Just someone." 

"Ah." 

They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease 
as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses 
thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings 
to the Uncertain Areas. 

"You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is Southend, 
there's something very odd about it..." 

"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep 
washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes I thought that was odd too. In 
fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six 
equal segments which danced and span giddily round each other in 
lewd and licentious formation, "there is something altogether very 
strange going on." 

Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, 
hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish 
stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for 
it. 

They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic 
thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats 
and suddenly heard a girl's voice. 

It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the 
power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling," and that 
was all. 

Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a 
source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe 
in. 

"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur. 

"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a 
measurement of probability." 



"Probability? What do you mean?" 

"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four 
against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one 
against. That's pretty improbable you know." 

A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without 
warning. 

"But what does it mean?" cried Arthur. 

"What, the custard?" 

"No, the measurement of probability!" 

"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of 
spaceship." 

"I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-class 
compartment." 

Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges. 

"Haaaauuurrgghhh..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and 
bending in unusual directions. "Southend seems to be melting away... 
the stars are swirling... a dustbowl... my legs are drifting off into the 
sunset... my left arm's come off too." A frightening thought struck him 
"Hell," he said, "how am I going to operate my digital watch now?" He 
wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction. 

"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it." 

Again came the voice. 

"Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and 
falling." 

Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. 

"Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on 
and is there any way of stopping it?" 

"Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an 
airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, 
"you are perfectly safe." 

"But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a 
perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out 
of limbs!" 

"It's alright. I've got them back now," said Arthur. 

"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," 
said the voice. 



"Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, 
but..." 

"Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you 
ought to be telling us?" 

The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the 
distance. 

"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold." 

The voice continued. 

"Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear 
around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have 
been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to 
the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against - 
possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the 
power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will 
be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal 
anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one 
against and falling." 

The voice cut out. 

Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. 

Ford was wildly excited. 

"Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a ship 
powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard 
rumors about it before! They were all officially denied, but they must 
have done it! They've built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is... 
Arthur? What's happening?" 

Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying 
to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little hands were 
squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were 
inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely. 

Arthur looked up. 

"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside 
who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked 
out." 



Chapter 10 


The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of 
crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, 
without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. 

It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a 
governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research 
team on Damogran. 

This, briefly, is the story of its discovery. 

The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by 
simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson 
Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian 
Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well 
understood - and such generators were often used to break the ice at 
parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments 
leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the 
Theory of Indeterminacy. 

Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand 
for this - partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly 
because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. 

Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they 
encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate 
the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the 
mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end 
they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually 
impossible. 

Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab 
after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this 
way: 

If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, 
then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in 
order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed 



that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup 
of really hot tea... and turn it on! 

He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had 
managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability 
generator out of thin air. 

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the 
Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a 
rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that 
the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass. 



Chapter 11 


The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked 
like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly 
clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had the 
plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, 
and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly 
oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, 
and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky 
shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal 
simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three- 
dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got 
miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large 
video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on 
the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex 
wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel 
head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too 
was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished 
it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid 
body didn't quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but 
something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, 
brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling 
with excitement. 

Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. 
Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship. 

"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and 
falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... 
we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her 
microphone off - then turned it back on, with a slight smile and 
continued: "Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own 
problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon." 

Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?" 



Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged. 

"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," 
she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." 

"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained 
Zaphod, "but do you really think it's wise under the circumstances? I 
mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the 
police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up 
hitchhikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million 
for good thinking, yeah?" 

He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his 
hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod's 
qualities of mind might include - dash, bravado, conceit - he was 
mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an 
extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main 
reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never 
really understood the significance of anything he did. 

"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in 
open space... you wouldn't want them to have died would you?" 

"Well, you know... no. Not as such, but..." 

"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on 
one side. 

"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later." 

"A second later and they would have been dead." 

"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a 
bit longer it would have gone away." 

"You'd been happy to let them die?" 

"Well, you know, not happy as such, but..." 

"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't pick 
them up." 

"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?" 

"The ship did." 

"Huh?" 

"The ship did. All by itself." 

"Huh?" 

"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive." 

"But that's incredible." 



"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable." 

"Er, yeah." 

"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the 
aliens. They're just a couple of guys I expect. I'll send the robot down 
to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!" 

In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then 
wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was 
about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an 
outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the 
room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her 
left shoulder. 

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its 
voice was low and hopeless. 

"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat. 

"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's 
something to occupy you and keep your mind off things." 

"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large 
mind." 

"Marvin!" warned Trillian. 

"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?" 

"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up 
here under surveillance." 

With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated 
micromodulation of pitch and timbre - nothing you could actually 
take offence at - Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and 
horror of all things human. 

"Just that?" he said. 

"Yes," said Trillian firmly. 

"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin. 

Zaphod leaped out of his seat. 

"She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will you?" 

"Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, "I'll do 
it." 

"Good..." snapped Zaphod, "great... thank you..." 

Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up 
towards him. 



"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically. 

"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really..." 

"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down." 

"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act as 
comes naturally and everything will be just fine." 

"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin. 

"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really... just part of 
life." 

"Marvin flashed him an electronic look. 

"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life." 

He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the 
cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him 

"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled 
Trillian. 

The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical 
apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division 
of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic 
Pal Who's Fun To Be With." 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division 
of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks 
who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a 
footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications 
from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics 
correspondent. 

Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that 
had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand 
years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the 
first against the wall when the revolution came." 

The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had 
sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves 
in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. 

"I think the ship's brand new," said Ford. 



"How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic 
device for measuring the age of metal?" 

"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of 
'the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right." 

Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. 

"It says: 'Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As 
soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes 
through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major 
governments.' Wow, this is big league stuff." 

Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, 
occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read - clearly 
Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his 
exile. 

Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand 
the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind 
wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible 
computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red 
button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words Please do 
not press this button again. He shook himself. 

"Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, 
"they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. 'A new generation of 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new 
GPP feature.'" 

"GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?" 

"Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities." 

"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly." 

A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless 
and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They span round and 
saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. 

"What?" they said. 

"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't 
even talk about it. Look at this door," he said, stepping through it. The 
irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of 
the sales brochure. "All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful 
and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their 
satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." 



As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did 
indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it. 
"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said. 

Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits 
chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing 
physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? 
What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further 
circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components 
of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a quick encore they 
measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic 
parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of 
despair shook the robot's body as he turned. 

"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the 
bridge. Flere I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take 
you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't." 

Fie turned and walked back to the hated door. 

"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government 
owns this ship?" 

Marvin ignored him. 

"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can 
tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates." 

With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and 
Marvin stomped through. 

"Come on," he said. 

The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with 
pleased little clicks and whirrs. 

"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation," said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming 
curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build robots 
with Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they tried it out with 
me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you?" 

Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. 

"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down at 
all am I?" 

"Which government..." started Ford again. 

"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen." 



"Stolen?" 

"Stolen?" mimicked Marvin. 

"Who by?" asked Ford. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five 
entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement 
piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, 
seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. Fie stared at the 
robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox...?" he said weakly. 

"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself 
on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I 
don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Flere's 
another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life." 

"No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are 
you alright?" 

Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he 
said. 



Chapter 12 


A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold 
cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of 
himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios 
had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; 
then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were 
made touch-sensitive-you merely had to brush the panels with your 
fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general 
direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular 
expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still 
if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. 

Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk 
music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. 

The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. 

"... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, 
broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock," squawked a voice, 
"and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms 
everywhere... and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang 
the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story tonight is 
the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by 
none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the 
question everyone's asking is... has the big Z finally flipped? 
Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, 
ex-confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as 
the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Worst 
Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time... 
has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain care 
specialist Gag Halfrunt..." 

The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, 
presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Well, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?" 
but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and 
through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and 
glared at Trillian - she had thrown the pencil. 



"Hey," he said, what do you do that for?" 

Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures. 

"I've just thought of something," she said. 

"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?" 

"You hear enough about yourself as it is." 

"I'm very insecure. We know that." 

"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important." 

"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it 
caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed. 

"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys..." 

"What couple of guys?" 

"The couple of guys we picked up." 

"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys." 

"We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." 

"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked. 

Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?" 

"Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?" 

"Well?" said Trillian. 

"Er... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod. 

"Which one?" 

"Any one." 

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship 
with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to 
be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid 
because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else 
to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact 
that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being 
genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and 
quite clearly was so - but not all the time, which obviously worried 
him, hence the act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than 
contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely 
stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. 

She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she 
could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to 
be that way. 



"There," she pointed, "right there." 

"Hey... Yeah!" said Zaphod. 

"Well?" she said. 

"Well what?" 

Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the 
inside of her head. She said, very calmly, "It's the same sector you 
originally picked me up in." 

He looked at her and then looked back at the screen. 

"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped 
straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come 
to be there? I mean that's nowhere." 

She ignored this. 

"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to me 
yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you know 
that." 

"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?" 

"Yes." 

"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the 
Universe to choose from? That's just too... I want to work this out. 
Computer!" 

The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which 
controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into 
communication mode. 

"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny 
ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, Hi there! 

"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for 
long but had already learned to loathe it. 

The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling 
detergent. 

"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help 
you solve it." 

"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of 
paper." 

"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a 
waste bin at the same time, "I understand. If you ever want..." 



"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to 
Trillian at the console. 

"OK, OK..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed 
down its speech channel again. 

Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability 
flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them. 

"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what the 
Improbability of their rescue was?" 

"Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two 
hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one 
against." 

"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys." 

"Yes." 

"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them 
up..." 

Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two-to-the power-of- 
Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional 
meaning in Improbability physics). 

"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle. 

"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. 

"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. 
Something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance 
sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum." 

Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the 
pencil away. 

"Bat's dots, I can't work it out." 

"Well?" 

Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his 
teeth. 

"OK," he said. "Computer!" 

The voice circuits sprang to life again. 

"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I want to 
do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer..." 

"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me." 

"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability 
forecast based on..." 



"Improbability data, yeah." 

"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little notion. 
Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by telephone 
numbers?" 

A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the 
other one. 

"Have you flipped?" he said. 

"No, but you will when I tell you that..." 

Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability 
flight path screen. 

"Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone 
number?" 

Numbers flashed up on the screen. 

The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. 

"What I was about to say was that..." 

"Don't bother please," said Trillian. 

"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod. 

"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens - they're on the way 
up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on 
any monitor cameras?" 



Chapter 13 


Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. 

"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes 
down my left hand side..." 

"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?" 

"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced 
but no one ever listens." 

"I can imagine." 

Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. 
"Well well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox..." 

Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand. 

"You know what's happened now of course?" 

"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know. 

"We've arrived at another of those doors." 

There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin 
eyed it suspiciously. 

"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?" 

"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance 
to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the 
highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today 
I shouldn't wonder." 

Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a 
hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open. 

"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy." 

Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground. 

"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't 
possibly get any worse it suddenly does." 

Fie heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur 
staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they 
heard Marvin's voice again. 



"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want 
me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?" 

"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice. 

Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. 

"What's...?" 

"Shhh," said Ford, "come in." 

Fie stepped through into the bridge. 

Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man 
lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the 
teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head 
seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand 
one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of 
things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. FHis 
jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while. 

The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling 
affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you 
could drop in." 

Ford was not going to be outcooled. 

"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the 
extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen." 

Arthur goggled at him. 

"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at 
Zaphod. 

"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's..." he paused, and decided to 
do the introductions the other way round. 

"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I saved 
him when his planet blew up." 

"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." FHis 
right-hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to 
having his teeth picked. 

Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin 
Zaphod Beeb..." 

"We've met," said Arthur sharply. 

When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily 
sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with 
yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first 



instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a 
rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the 
same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. 

"Err... what?" 

"I said we've met." 

Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum 
sharply. 

"Hey... er, have we? Hey... er..." 

Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt 
he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having 
lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much 
about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life 
in Peking. 

"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod 
Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith 
from Croydon." 

"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod 
Beeblebrox - or should I say... Phil?" 

"What!" shouted Ford. 

"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory 
for species." 

"It was at a party," pursued Arthur. 

"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod. 

"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford. 

Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth... 
England..." 

Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile. 

"London," insisted Arthur, "Islington." 

"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party." 

This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards 
between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" he said to Zaphod. "You don't 
mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?" 

"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just 
dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere..." 

"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!" 

"Well I didn't know that did I?" 



"But what were you doing there?" 

"Looking about, you know." 

"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, 

"a fancy dress party..." 

"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford. 

"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl... oh well, look it 
doesn't matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke 
anyway..." 

"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford. 
"Who was the lady?" 

"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her. 
I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though. Beautiful, 
charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a 
bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours 
barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you 
talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet." I never saw her 
again." 

"Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford. 

"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He 
only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, 
but..." 

"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet," 
said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge. She 
gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks 
and then turned her attention to the ship's controls again. 

There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled 
mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words. 

"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?" 

"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in 
Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? It was 
either that or the dole queue again on Monday." 

"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum 
now complete." 

Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. 

"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time 
we use the Improbability drive?" 



"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said. 



Chapter 14 


The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now 
on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease 
knowing that they had been brought together not of their own 
volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of 
physics - as if relationships between people were susceptible to the 
same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and 
molecules. 

As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful to 
retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. 

Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage 
which contained her last and only links with Earth - two white mice 
that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to 
see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction 
to the planet's destruction. It seemed remote and unreal and she 
could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice 
scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic 
treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she 
shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny 
flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the 
void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think 
about. 

Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he 
wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could remember 
he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. 

Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry 
about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable 
arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to 
conform to a pattern that he couldn't see. 

Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the 
road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he 
was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for 
a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be 



something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his 
finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was 
frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was 
there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod, 
he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had 
turned unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life 
with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it 
was often difficult to tell which was which. 

Arthur slept: he was terribly tired. 

There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open. 

"Zaphod...?" 

"Yeah?" 

"I think we just found what you came to look for." 

"Hey, yeah?" 

Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a 
small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried 
to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but 
couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, 
wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge. 

As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched 
excitedly over the instruments. 

"See? The ship's about to move into orbit," Trillian was saying. 
"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you 
predicted." 

Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. 

"Ford!" he hissed. "Hey, come and take a look at this." 

Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flashing 
over a screen. 

"You recognize those Galactic coordinates?" said Zaphod. 

"No." 

"I'll give you a clue. Computer!" 

"Hi gang!" enthused the computer. "This is getting real sociable 
isn't it?" 

"Shut up," said Zaphod, "and show up the screens." 



Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the 
consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the 
external monitor screens. 

There was absolutely nothing on them. 

"Recognize that?" whispered Zaphod. 

Ford frowned. 

"Er, no," he said. 

"What do you see?" 

"Nothing." 

"Recognize it?" 

"What are you talking about?" 

"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud." 

"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?" 

"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a 
dark screen." 

"Very good." 

Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, 
almost childishly so. 

"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!" 

"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?" said Ford. 

"What would you reckon to find here?" urged Zaphod. 

"Nothing." 

"No stars? No planets?" 

"No." 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod, "rotate angle of vision through one 
eighty degrees and don't talk about it!" 

For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a 
brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size 
of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one - a 
binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the 
picture - a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side 
of the planet. 

"I've found it!" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. "I've found it! 

Ford stared at it in astonishment. 

"What is it?" he said. 



"That..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever 
existed." 



Chapter 15 


(Excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, 
Section 5a, Entry: Magrathea) 

Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days 
of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free. 

Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking 
adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. 
In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real 
men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha 
Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all 
dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split 
infinitives that no man had split before - and thus was the Empire 
forged. 

Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly 
natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor 
- at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most 
successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, 
and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the 
worlds they'd settled on - none of them was entirely satisfactory: 
either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, 
or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong 
shade of pink. 

And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of 
specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of 
this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers 
sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream 
planets - gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots 
of earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards 
that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect. 

But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon 
became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was 
reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire 



collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, 
disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured 
into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned 
political economy. 

Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the 
obscurity of legend. 

In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it. 



Chapter 16 


Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. 

Ford was waving his arms about. 

"You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a 
fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want 
them to grow up to become economists, it's..." 

"And that's what we are currently in orbit around," insisted Zaphod. 

"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around," 
said Ford, "but this ship..." 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 

"Oh no..." 

"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling 
just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out 
of any programme you care to run through me." 

Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on 
in but keep quiet. 

"Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us again what our present trajectory 
is." 

"A real pleasure feller," it burbled, "we are currently in orbit at an 
altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of 
Magrathea." 

"Proving nothing," said Ford. "I wouldn't trust that computer to 
speak my weight." 

"I can do that for you, sure," enthused the computer, punching out 
more tickertape. "I can even work out you personality problems to 
ten decimal places if it will help." 

Trillian interrupted. 

"Zaphod," she said, "any minute now we will be swinging round to 
the daylight side of this planet," adding, "whatever it turns out to be." 

"Fley, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it 
would be isn't it?" 



"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone, 
it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of cold 
rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it." 

"OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least give our eyes a good 
time. Computer!" 

"Hi there! What can I..." 

"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again." 

A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens - the planet 
rolling away beneath them. 

They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety 
with excitement. 

"We are now traversing the night side..." he said in a hushed voice. 
The planet rolled on. 

"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath 
us..." he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to 
what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was 
piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea! 

"In a few seconds," he continued, "we should see... there!" 

The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp 
can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from 
space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy. 

Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. 
It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent 
blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, 
searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of 
colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. 

"The fires of dawn...!" breathed Zaphod. "The twin suns of 
Soulianis and Rahm...!" 

"Or whatever," said Ford quietly. 

"Soulianis and Rahm!" insisted Zaphod. 

The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music 
floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because 
he hated humans so much. 

As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement 
burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new 
planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him 



that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to 
make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile. 
Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to 
believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? 

All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to 
Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. 

"I only know what Zaphod's told me," she whispered. "Apparently 
Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one 
seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends 
say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets." 

Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something 
important. Suddenly he realized what it was. 

"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked. 

More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of 
Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the 
black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the 
planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day - 
grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a 
crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the 
distant horizon - ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities - but 
as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity 
and nothing would transpire. The planet's surface was blurred by time, 
by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it 
for century upon century. 

Clearly, it was very very old. 

A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey 
landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, 
he could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. 

"Well, even supposing it is..." 

"It is," said Zaphod. 

"Which it isn't," continued Ford. "What do you want with it anyway? 
There's nothing there." 

"Not on the surface," said Zaphod. 

"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not here 
for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after?" 



One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round 
to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything 
very much. 

"Well," said Zaphod airily, "it's partly the curiosity, partly a sense of 
adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the money..." 

Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that 
Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all. 

"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian 
shivering. 

"Ah, take no notice," said Zaphod, "with half the wealth of the 
former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look 
frumpy." 

Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some 
ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of 
exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of 
wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have 
meaning now. He shrugged. 

"I think it's just a dead planet," he said. 

"The suspense is killing me," said Arthur testily. 

Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all 
parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in 
any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed 
in advance. 

The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea. 

The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient 
automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three 
coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, 
and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias 
and an innocent sperm whale. 

In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no 
revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained 
the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since 
it is of no significance whatsoever. 



Chapter 17 


After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to 
reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day 
had left him with. He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had 
provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, 
but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very 
interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant 
but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a 
spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny 
experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres 
of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, 
no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a 
cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The 
Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major 
land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system. 

Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the 
screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren 
greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question 
which had been bothering him. 

"Is it safe?" he said. 

"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of 
course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised 
families by now." At which point a strange and inexplicable sound 
thrilled suddenly through the bridge - a noise as of a distant fanfare; 
a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was 
equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to 
you..." 

Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 

"Hi there!" 


"What the photon is it?" 



"Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast at 
us." 

"A what? A recording?" 

"Shush!" said Ford. "It's carrying on." 

The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was 
underscored with quite unmistakable menace. 

"This is a recorded announcement," it said, "as I'm afraid we're all 
out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you 
for your esteemed visit..." 

("A voice from ancient Magrathea!" shouted Zaphod. "OK, OK," 
said Ford.) 

"... but regrets," continued the voice, "that the entire planet is 
temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care to leave 
your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, 
kindly speak when you hear the tone." 

A short buzz followed, then silence. 

"They want to get rid of us," said Trillian nervously. "What do we 
do?" 

"It's just a recording," said Zaphod. "We keep going. Got that, 
computer?" 

"I got it," said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of 
speed. 

They waited. 

After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the 
voice. 

"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is 
resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines 
and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to 
select from all that's best in contemporary geography." The menace 
in the voice took on a sharper edge. "Meanwhile we thank our clients 
for their kind interest and would ask them to leave. Now." 

Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. 

"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?" he 
suggested. 

"Shhh!" said Zaphod. "There's absolutely nothing to be worried 
about." 



"Then why's everyone so tense?" 

"They're just interested!" shouted Zaphod. "Computer, start a 
descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing." 

This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly 
cold. 

"It is most gratifying," it said, "that your enthusiasm for our planet 
continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the 
guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a 
special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and 
the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy 
detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives... thank you." 

The voice snapped off. 

"Oh," said Trillian. 

"Er..." said Arthur. 

"Well?" said Ford. 

"Look," said Zaphod, "will you get it into your heads? That's just a 
recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't apply to us, get 
it?" 

"What," said Trillian quietly, "about the missiles?" 

"Missiles? Don't make me laugh." 

Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear 
screen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were 
climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of 
magnification brought them into close focus - two massively real 
rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was 
shocking. 

"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us," 
said Ford. 

Zaphod stared at them in astonishment. 

"Hey this is terrific!" he said. "Someone down there is trying to kill 
us!" 

"Terrific," said Arthur. 

"But don't you see what this means?" 

"Yes. We're going to die." 

"Yes, but apart from that." 

"Apart from that?" 



"It means we must be on to something!" 

"How soon can we get off it?" 

Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became 
larger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so 
that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. 

"As a matter of interest," said Trillian, "what are we going to do?" 

"Just keep cool," said Zaphod. 

"Is that all?" shouted Arthur. 

"No, we're also going to... er... take evasive action!" said Zaphod 
with a sudden access of panic. "Computer, what evasive action can 
we take?" 

"Er, none I'm afraid, guys," said the computer. 

"... or something," said Zaphod,"... er..." he said. 

"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system," 
explained the computer brightly, "impact minus forty-five seconds. 
Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax." 

Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions 
simultaneously. "Right!" he said. "Er... we've got to get manual 
control of this ship." 

"Can you fly her?" asked Ford pleasantly. 

"No, can you?" 

"No." 

"Trillian, can you?" 

"No." 

"Fine," said Zaphod, relaxing. "We'll do it together." 

"I can't either," said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert 
himself. 

"I'd guessed that," said Zaphod. "OK computer, I want full manual 
control now." 

"You got it," said the computer. 

Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles 
sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded 
polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these 
controls had never been used before. 

Zaphod stared at them wildly. 



"OK, Ford," he said, "full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or 
something..." 

"Good luck guys," chirped the computer, "impact minus thirty 
seconds..." 

Ford leapt to the controls - only a few of them made any 
immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and 
screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way 
simultaneously. Fie released half of them and the ship span round in a 
tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the 
oncoming missiles. 

Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone 
was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held 
them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod 
struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a 
savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. 

The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed 
upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford's 
copy of The FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another 
section of the control console with the combined result that the 
Guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best 
ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an 
Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much 
sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often 
paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich 
idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. 

It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew 
sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized 
because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise 
completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not 
eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. 

"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys..." said the computer. 

"Then turn the bloody engines back on!" bawled Zaphod. 

"OK, sure thing, guys," said the computer. With a subtle roar the 
engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and 
headed back towards the missiles again. 

The computer started to sing. 



"When you walk through the storm..." it whined nasally, "hold your 
head up high..." 

Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din 
of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. 

"And don't... be afraid... of the dark!" Eddie wailed. 

The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down 
and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for 
any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. 

"At the end of the storm..." crooned Eddie. 

The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they 
thundered towards the ship. 

"... is a golden sky..." 

But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully 
corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and 
they passed right under it. 

"And the sweet silver songs of the lark... Revised impact time 
fifteen seconds fellas... Walk on through the wind..." 

The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back 
into pursuit. 

"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite 
definitely going to die aren't we?" 

"I wish you'd stop saying that," shouted Ford. 

"Well we are aren't we?" 

"Yes." 

"Walk on through the rain..." sang Eddie. 

A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. 

"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?" he 
said. "We could probably reach that." 

"What are you crazy?" said Zaphod. "Without proper programming 
anything could happen." 

"Does that matter at this stage?" shouted Arthur. 

"Though your dreams be tossed and blown..." sand Eddie. 

Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces 
of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling. 

"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart..." 



"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability 
Drive?" shouted Trillian. 

"And you'll never walk alone... Impact minus five seconds, it's been 
great knowing you guys, God bless... You'll ne... ver... walk... alone!" 

"I said," yelled Trillian, "does anyone know..." 

The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of 
noise and light. 



Chapter 18 


And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of 
Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly 
redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate 
pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, 
leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow 
flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main 
computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created 
the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of 
exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the 
conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful 
wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the 
marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you 
touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your 
hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to 
reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear 
where they were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful. 

Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What 
the hell happened?" 

"Well I was just saying," said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, 
"there's this Improbability Drive switch over here..." he waved at 
where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. 

"But where are we?" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral 
staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand. 

"Exactly where we were, I think..." said Trillian, as all about them 
the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of 
Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them. 

Zaphod leapt out of his seat. 

"Then what's happened to the missiles?" he said. 

A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. 

"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a 
bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..." 



"At an Improbability Factor," cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a bit, 
"of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one 
hundred and twenty-eight to one against." 

Zaphod stared at Arthur. 

"Did you think of that, Earthman?" he demanded. 

"Well," said Arthur, "all I did was..." 

"That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability 
Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. Hey 
kid you just saved our lives, you know that?" 

"Oh," said Arthur, "well, it was nothing really..." 

"Was it?" said Zaphod. "Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer, take 
us in to land." 

"But..." 

"I said forget it." 

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all 
probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence 
several miles above the surface of an alien planet. 

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this 
poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its 
identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being 
a whale any more. 

This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began 
its life till the moment it ended it. 

Ah...! What's happening? it thought. 

Er, excuse me, who am I? 

Hello? 

Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? 

What do I mean by who am I? 

Calm down, get a grip now... oh! this is an interesting sensation, 
what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in my... my... well 
I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make 
any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I 
shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach. 

Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this 
whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my 



head? Perhaps I can call that... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do... 
perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what 
it's for. It must be something very important because there certainly 
seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What's this thing? This... let's call 
it a tail - yeah, tail. Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good can't I? 
Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but 
I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now - have I built up any 
coherent picture of things yet? 

No. 

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, 
so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation... 

Or is it the wind? 

There really is a lot of that now isn't it? 

And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me 
very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide 
sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a 
good name - ground! 

I wonder if it will be friends with me? 

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. 

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the 
bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have 
speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had 
thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the 
universe than we do now. 



Chapter 19 


"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste 
at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the 
corner under a small palm tree. 

Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a 
panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold 
had now landed. 

"Oh, the Paranoid Android," he said. "Yeah, we'll take him." 

"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?" 

"You think you've got problems," said Marvin as if he was 
addressing a newly occupied coffin, "what are you supposed to do if 
you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that. 
I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't 
know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to 
your level." 

Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. 

"My white mice have escaped!" she said. 

An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of 
Zaphod's faces. 

"Nuts to your white mice," he said. 

Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. 

It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater 
attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only 
the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, 
instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) 
the second. 

"Good afternoon boys." 

The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a 
matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at 
the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface. 



They looked at each other in puzzlement. 

"It's the computer," explained Zaphod. "I discovered it had an 
emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out better." 

"Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new 
planet," continued Eddie's new voice, "so I want you all wrapped up 
snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed 
monsters." 

Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch. 

"I'm sorry," he said, "I think we might be better off with a slide 
rule." 

"Right!" snapped the computer. "Who said that?" 

"Will you open the exit hatch please, computer?" said Zaphod 
trying not to get angry. 

"Not until whoever said that owns up," urged the computer, 
stamping a few synapses closed. 

"Oh God," muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started 
to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day sentinent 
life forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could 
humans demonstrate their independence of computers. 

"Come on," said Eddie sternly. 

"Computer..." began Zaphod... 

"I'm waiting," interrupted Eddie. "I can wait all day if necessary..." 

"Computer..." said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of 
some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and 
had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, "if 
you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to 
your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got 
that?" 

Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this. 

Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive 
thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a 
human being and saying Blood... blood... blood... blood... 

Finally Eddie said quietly, "I can see this relationship is something 
we're all going to have to work at," and the hatchway opened. 

An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and 
stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea. 



"It'll all end in tears, I know it," shouted Eddie after them and 
closed the hatchway again. 

A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again 
response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise. 



Chapter 20 


Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were 
dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less 
interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all 
vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was 
very cold. 

Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by 
himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. 

The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air 
clasped his throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind. 

"It's fantastic..." he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound 
carried badly in this thin atmosphere. 

"Desolate hole if you ask me," said Ford. "I could have more fun in 
a cat litter." He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the planets in all the 
star systems of all the Galaxy - didn't he just have to turn up at a 
dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hot 
dog stand in evidence. He stooped down and picked up a cold clot of 
earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands 
of light years to look at. 

"No," insisted Arthur, "don't you understand, this is the first time 
I've actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien 
world...! Pity it's such a dump though." 

Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have 
sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner 
of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see 
was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. 

She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of 
Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to 
come and join him. 

He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he 
was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind. 



As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware 
that it seemed to be circular - a crater about a hundred and fifty 
yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was 
spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a 
piece. It was wet. It was rubbery. 

With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat. 

At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod. 

"Look," he said, pointing into the crater. 

In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that 
hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence 
was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's throat. 

"I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it?" murmured Arthur, 
and then wished he hadn't. 

"Come," said Zaphod and started back down into the crater. 

"What, down there?" said Trillian with severe distaste. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "come on. I've got something to show you." 

"We can see it," said Trillian. 

"Not that," said Zaphod, "something else. Come on." 

They all hesitated. 

"Come on," insisted Zaphod, "I've found a way in." 

"In?" said Arthur in horror. 

"Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force 
of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go. 
Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths 
of time itself..." 

Marvin started his ironical humming again. 

Zaphod hit him and he shut up. 

With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the 
incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate 
creator. 

"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it." 

The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a 
network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by 
collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a way 
into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air 



wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, 
little was visible in the dusty gloom. 

"According to the legends," he said, "the Magratheans lived most 
of their lives underground." 

"Why's that?" said Arthur. "Did the surface become too polluted or 
overpopulated?" 

"No, I don't think so," said Zaphod. "I think they just didn't like it 
very much." 

"Are you sure you know what you're doing?" said Trillian peering 
nervously into the darkness. "We've been attacked once already you 
know." 

"Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus 
the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Er, hey Earthman..." 

"Arthur," said Arthur. 

"Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this 
end of the passageway. OK?" 

"Guard?" said Arthur. "What from? You just said there's no one 
here." 

"Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?" said Zaphod. 

"Whose? Yours or mine?" 

"Good lad. OK, here we go." 

Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and 
Ford. 

"Well I hope you all have a really miserable time," complained 
Arthur. 

"Don't worry," Marvin assured him, "they will." 

In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. 

Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's 
graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in. 

Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself 
off. 

Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, 
but trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torch beam 
around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the 
touch, the air thick with decay. 



"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "An inhabited planet. 
Magrathea," and he strode on through the dirt and debris that 
littered the tile floor. 

Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, 
though it was less thoroughly squalid. 

At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics - 
simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied 
one of them but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to 
Zaphod. 

"Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?" 

"I think they're just strange symbols of some kind," said Zaphod, 
hardly glancing back. 

Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. 

From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into 
smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict 
computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. 
Trillian followed. 

"Look," said Ford, "you reckon this is Magrathea..." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and we heard the voice, right?" 

"OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea - for the moment. 
What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you 
found it. You didn't just look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure." 

"Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky 
guesses. Easy." 

"And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it 
with?" 

"I stole it to look for a lot of things." 

"A lot of things?" said Ford in surprise. "Like what?" 

"I don't know." 

"What?" 

"I don't know what I'm looking for." 

"Why not?" 

"Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I 
wouldn't be able to look for them." 


"What, are you crazy?" 



"It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet," said Zaphod quietly. "I 
only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its 
current conditions. And its current conditions are not good." 

For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with 
a mind suddenly full of worry. 

"Listen old friend, if you want to..." started Ford eventually. 

"No, wait... I'll tell you something," said Zaphod. "I freewheel a lot. 

I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I'll 
become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it's easy. I decide 
to steal this ship. I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just 
happens. Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always 
works out. It's like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working 
though you never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop 
and think - why did I want to do something? - how did I work out 
how to do it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it. 
Like I have now. It's a big effort to talk about it." 

Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he 
frowned and said, "Last night I was worrying about this again. About 
the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly. Then 
it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was 
using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it. I 
put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody 
had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I 
couldn't use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check. 

"I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the 
encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening test 
on both my heads - all the tests I had to go through under 
government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency 
could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing 
unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, 
irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have 
guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, 
completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the 
results from one head on top of the results from the other head. Still 
nothing. Finally I got silly, because I'd given it all up as nothing more 
than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I packed it in was 
take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter. 
You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when 



I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading 
scouts?" 

Ford nodded. 

"And there it was," said Zaphod, "clear as day. A whole section in 
the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to 
anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the 
synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of 
cerebellum." 

Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white. 

"Somebody did that to you?" whispered Ford. 

"Yeah." 

"But have you any idea who? Or why?" 

"Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was." 

"You know? Flow do you know?" 

"Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. 
They left them there for me to see." 

Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl. 

"Initials? Burnt into your brain?" 

"Yeah." 

"Well, what were they, for God's sake?" 

Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he 
looked away. 

"Z.B.," he said. 

At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and 
gas started to pour into the chamber. 

"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out. 



Chapter 21 


On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. 

Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at 
random. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book 
and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a 
good idea at the time. 

One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates 
the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the 
University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career 
studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave 
harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of 
drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, 
became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had 
happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years. 

There followed a long period of painstaking research during which 
he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and 
eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the 
public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, 
along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, 
walking treeoids and superintendent shades of the colour blue, there 
was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to 
this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping 
away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they 
knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly 
biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the 
good life. 

And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet 
Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have 
worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap 
green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote 



a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate 
reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves 
in public. 

When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates 
that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small 
asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that 
nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. 

There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 
60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, 
and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro 
business. 

Arthur read this, and put the book down. 

The robot still sat there, completely inert. 

Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked 
around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over 
Magrathea. 

He went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because 
even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody. 

"Night's falling," he said. "Look robot, the stars are coming out." 

From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, 
and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen. 

The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. 

"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?" 

"But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest 
dreams... the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into 
space." 

"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish." 

"We only ever had the one sun at home," persevered Arthur, "I 
came from a planet called Earth you know." 

"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds 
awful." 

"Ah no, it was a beautiful place." 

"Did it have oceans?" 

"Oh yes," said Arthur with a sigh, "great wide rolling blue oceans..." 

"Can't bear oceans," said Marvin. 



"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?" 

"Hate them," said Marvin. "Where are you going?" 

Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again. 

"I think I'll just take another walk," he said. 

"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and 
ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a 
second later. 

Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation 
a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of 
the crater. 

Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no 
moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because 
of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed 
him. 



Chapter 22 


He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last 
glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was 
tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned 
his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort 
of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even 
to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise. 

Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he 
turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when 
Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away 
stood a small craft of some kind - a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. 
It shed a dim pool of light around it. 

The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed. 

"You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet," he said. 

"Who... who are you?" stammered Arthur. 

The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his 
face. 

"My name is not important," he said. 

He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was 
clearly something he felt he didn't have to rush at. Arthur felt 
awkward. 

"I... er... you startled me..." he said, lamely. 

The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his 
eyebrows. 

"Hmmmm?" he said. 

"I said you startled me." 

"Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you." 

Arthur frowned at him. "But you shot at us! There were missiles..." 
he said. 

The man chuckled slightly. 



"An automatic system," he said and gave a small sigh. "Ancient 
computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark 
millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think 
they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony." 

He looked gravely at Arthur and said, "I'm a great fan of science 
you know." 

"Oh... er, really?" said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's 
curious, kindly manner disconcerting. 

"Oh, yes," said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. 

"Ah," said Arthur, "er..." He had an odd felling of being like a man 
in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's husband 
wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle 
remarks about the weather and leaves again. 

"You seem ill at ease," said the old man with polite concern. 

"Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren't really expecting to 
find anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead 
or something..." 

"Dead?" said the old man. "Good gracious no, we have but slept." 

"Slept?" said Arthur incredulously. 

"Yes, through the economic recession you see," said the old man, 
apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he 
was talking about or not. 

"Er, economic recession?" 

"Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy 
collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a 
luxury commodity you see..." 

He paused and looked at Arthur. 

"You know we built planets do you?" he asked solemnly. 

"Well yes," said Arthur, "I’d sort of gathered..." 

"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into 
his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have 
endless fun doing the little bits in fjords... so anyway," he said trying 
to find his thread again, "the recession came and we decided it would 
save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed 
the computers to revive us when it was all over." 

The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. 



"The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market 
prices you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else had 
rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services." 

Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. 

"That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it?" 

"Is it?" asked the old man mildly. "I'm sorry. I'm a bit out of touch." 

He pointed down into the crater. 

"Is that robot yours?" he said. 

"No," came a thin metallic voice from the crater, "I'm mine." 

"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of 
electronic sulking machine." 

"Bring it," said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a 
note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He called to 
Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, 
which he wasn't. 

"On second thoughts," said the old man, "leave it here. You must 
come with me. Great things are afoot." He turned towards his craft 
which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly 
towards them through the dark. 

Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show 
of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater 
again muttering sour nothings to himself. 

"Come," called the old man, "come now or you will be late." 

"Late?" said Arthur. "What for?" 

"What is your name, human?" 

"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur. 

"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's 
a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into his tired old 
eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can 
be very effective." 

Arthur blinked at him. 

"What an extraordinary person," he muttered to himself. 

"I beg your pardon?" said the old man. 

"Oh nothing, I'm sorry," said Arthur in embarrassment. "Alright, 
where do we go?" 



"In my aircar," said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the 
craft which had settled silently next to them. "We are going deep into 
the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived 
from its five-million-year slumber. Magrathea awakes." 

Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old 
man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft 
as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him. 

He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of 
tiny lights on the instrument panel. 

"Excuse me," he said to him, "what is your name by the way?" 

"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came 
into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said,"... is 
Slartibartfast." 

Arthur practically choked. 

"I beg your pardon?" he spluttered. 

"Slartibartfast," repeated the old man quietly. 

"Slartibartfast?" 

The old man looked at him gravely. 

"I said it wasn't important," he said. 

The aircar sailed through the night. 



Chapter 23 


It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what 
they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always 
assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had 
achieved so much - the wheel. New York, wars and so on - whilst all 
the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a 
good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they 
were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons. 

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending 
destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert 
mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were 
misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for 
tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own 
means shortly before the Vogons arrived. 

The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly 
sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through 
a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the 
message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. 

In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent 
than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural 
research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting 
frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that 
once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was 
entirely according to these creatures' plans. 



Chapter 24 


Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft 
glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It 
sped swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, 
and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in 
conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was 
comfortable enough, and then left it at that. 

Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but 
the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference 
points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost 
believe they were hardly moving at all. 

Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within 
seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was 
travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out 
what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to 
discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft 
dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be 
a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and 
Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next 
thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to 
surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small 
black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took 
him several seconds to realize what had happened. 

They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed 
had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a 
stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane 
blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they 
were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour. 

He closed his eyes in terror. 

After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he 
sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later 
became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. 



He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, 
threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a 
crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped it 
was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their 
terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could 
see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was irritating because it 
played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or 
tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it 
might be ultra violet. 

Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. 

"Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea." 

"How did you know I was an Earthman?" demanded Arthur. 

"These things will become clear to you," said the old man gently, 

"at least," he added with slight doubt in his voice, "clearer than they 
are at the moment." 

He continued: "I should warn you that the chamber we are about 
to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... 
large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of 
hyperspace. It may disturb you." 

Arthur made nervous noises. 

Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. 
"It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight." 

The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly 
Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. 

It wasn't infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. 
Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity - distance is 
incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into 
which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very 
very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than 
infinity itself. 

Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense 
speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the 
open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an 
invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. 

The wall. 



The wall defied the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The 
wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides 
passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo 
could kill a man. 

The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser 
measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to 
infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it 
also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds away. In other 
words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over 
three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light. 

"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, 
travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly 
forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our 
factory floor." 

Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged 
away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess 
at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal 
and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. 

"This," said Slartibartfast, "is where we make most of our planets 
you see." 

"You mean," said Arthur, trying to form the words, "you mean 
you're starting it all up again now?" 

"No no, good heavens no," exclaimed the old man, "no, the Galaxy 
isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been awakened 
to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special 
clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the 
distance in front of us." 

Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick out the 
floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of 
the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though 
this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put 
one's finger on. 

At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure 
and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark 
sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that 
were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture 
of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images 



rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down 
and make sense. 

Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was 
looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite 
sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility 
for any further thinking in that direction. 

The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. 

"The Earth..." whispered Arthur. 

"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully. 
"We're making a copy from our original blueprints." 

There was a pause. 

"Are you trying to tell me," said Arthur, slowly and with control, 
"that you originally... made the Earth?" 

"Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever go to a place... I think it 
was called Norway?" 

"No," said Arthur, "no, I didn't." 

"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award 
you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its 
destruction." 

"You were upset!" 

"Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much. It 
was a quite shocking cock-up." 

"Huh?" said Arthur. 

"The mice were furious." 

"The mice were furious?" 

"Oh yes," said the old man mildly. 

"Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled 
platypuses, but..." 

"Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they?" 

"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up 
and went mad now?" 

For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man 
tried patiently to explain. 

"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, 
and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion 



of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another 
one." 

Only one word registered with Arthur. 

"Mice?" he said. 

"Indeed Earthman." 

"Look, sorry - are we talking about the little white furry things with 
the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early 
sixties sit corns?" 

Slartibartfast coughed politely. 

"Earthman," he said, "it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of 
speech. Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea 
for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit corns of 
which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not 
quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our 
dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole 
business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front." 

The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. 

"They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid." 

Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. 

"Ah no," he said, "I see the source of the misunderstanding now. 

No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do 
experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, 
Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was hat the mice 
would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes 
and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be 
examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to 
learn all sorts of things about our own..." 

Arthur's voice tailed off. 

"Such subtlety..." said Slartibartfast, "one has to admire it." 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide 
your thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating 
the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, 
- if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous." 

He paused for effect. 



"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever 
hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people have 
formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year 
research programme... 

"Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time." 

"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems." 



Chapter 25 


There are of course many problems connected with life, of which 
some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? 
Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing 
digital watches? 

Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan¬ 
dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan¬ 
dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with 
the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to 
interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious 
game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent 
reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and 
solve their problems once and for all. 

And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super 
computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the 
data banks had been connected up it had started from I think 
therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and 
income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. 

It was the size of a small city. 

Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive 
office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest 
ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark carpeting 
was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved 
prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were 
deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out 
upon a tree-lined public square. 

On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed 
programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into 
the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their 
entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves 
calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the 



desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-bound 
notebooks. 

Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. 

For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after 
exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and 
touched a small black panel. 

The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now 
in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich 
resonant and deep. 

It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the 
second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have 
been called into existence?" 

Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. 

"Your task, O Computer..." began Fook. 

"No, wait a minute, this isn't right," said Lunkwill, worried. "We 
distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and 
we're not making do with second best. Deep Thought," he addressed 
the computer, "are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest 
most powerful computer in all time?" 

"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, 
"and such I am." 

Another worried look passed between the two programmers. 
Lunkwill cleared his throat. 

"There must be some mistake," he said, "are you not a greatest 
computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the 
atoms in a star in a millisecond?" 

"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with 
unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus - mention it not." 

"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater 
analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of 
Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single 
dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?" 

"A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask 
this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in 
the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff." 

The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. 
Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. 



"But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the 
Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, 
the Magic and Indefatigable?" 

"The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said 
Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off an 
Arcturan MegaDonkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a walk 
afterwards." 

"Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?" 

"There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing 
tones. "I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of 
Space and Time." 

"But the second?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the 
second? You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron 
Titan Muller are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the..." 

Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console. 

"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic 
simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to 
come after me!" 

Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and 
muttered, "I think this is getting needlessly messianic." 

"You know nothing of future time," pronounced Deep Thought, 
"and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta 
streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a 
computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to 
calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design." 

Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill. 

"Can we get on and ask the question?" he said. 

Lunkwill motioned him to wait. 

"What computer is this of which you speak?" he asked. 

"I will speak of it no further in this present time," said Deep 
Thought. "Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function. 
Speak." 

They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. 

"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed 
you to perform is this. We want you to tell us..." he paused,"... the 
Answer!" 



"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?" 

"Life!" urged Fook. 

"The Universe!" said Lunkwill. 

"Everything!" they said in chorus. 

Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. 

"Tricky," he said finally. 

"But can you do it?" 

Again, a significant pause. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it." 

"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement." 

"A simple answer?" added Lunkwill. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about it." 

A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open 
and two angry men wearing the coarse faded - blue robes and belts 
of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the 
ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. 

"We demand admission!" shouted the younger of the two men 
elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. 

"Come on," shouted the older one, "you can't keep us out!" He 
pushed a junior programmer back through the door. 

"We demand that you can't keep us out!" bawled the younger one, 
though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts 
were being made to stop him. 

"Who are you?" said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. "What do 
you want?" 

"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. 

"And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one. 

Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. "It's alright," he explained 
angrily, "you don't need to demand that." 

"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am 
Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we 
demand is solid facts!" 

"No we don't!" exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. "That is precisely 
what we don't demand!" 



Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't 
demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. 

I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!" 

"But who the devil are you?" exclaimed an outraged Fook. 

"We," said Majikthise, "are Philosophers." 

"Though we may not be," said Vroomfondel waving a warning 
finger at the programmers. 

"Yes we are," insisted Majikthise. "We are quite definitely here as 
representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, 
Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, 
and we want it off now!" 

"What's the problem?" said Lunkwill. 

"I'll tell you what the problem is mate," said Majikthise, 
"demarcation, that's the problem!" 

"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may 
not be the problem!" 

"You just let the machines get on with the adding up," warned 
Majikthise, "and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very 
much. You want to check your legal position you do mate. Under law 
the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable 
prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and 
actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we? I mean 
what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may 
or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his 
bleeding phone number the next morning?" 

"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined 
areas of doubt and uncertainty!" 

Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room. 

"Might I make an observation at this point?" inquired Deep 
Thought. 

"We'll go on strike!" yelled Vroomfondel. 

"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national 
Philosopher's strike on your hands!" 

The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary 
bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet 
speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little 
more power. 



"All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my circuits 
are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the 
Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything - " he paused 
and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before 
continuing more quietly, "but the programme will take me a little 
while to run." 

Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. 

"How long?" he said. 

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought. 

Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other. 

"Seven and a half million years...!" they cried in chorus. 

"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about it, 
didn't I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is 
bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the 
whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their 
own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and 
who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourself? So 
long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough 
and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep 
yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?" 

The two philosophers gaped at him. 

"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. 
Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?" 

"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains 
must be too highly trained Majikthise." 

So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door 
and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams. 



Chapter 26 


"Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the 
salient points of the story to him, "but I don't understand what all this 
has got to do with the Earth and mice and things." 

"That is but the first half of the story Earthman," said the old man. 
"If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half 
millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you 
to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our 
Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you would care to take a quick 
stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's only half completed I'm afraid - 
we haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in 
the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of 
the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and..." 

"No thank you," said Arthur, "it wouldn't be quite the same." 

"No," said Slartibartfast, "it won't be," and he turned the aircar 
round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall. 



Chapter 27 


Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an 
explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. 

"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life- 
support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we 
discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's 
going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know. Look why 
don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?" 

He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been 
made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus. 

"It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus," explained the 
old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under 
tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "Here," he said, 
"hold these," and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur. 

The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. 

He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. 
Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as 
far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy 
spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear - many were 
cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining, a 
fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation 
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by 
the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged 
with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly 
coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival 
was in the air. 

Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all 
without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to 
reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for 
everyone's attention. 



A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building 
which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a 
Tannoy. 

"O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!" he cried out. 
"Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest 
and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The 
Time of Waiting is over!" 

Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and 
wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked 
rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving 
their legs in the air. 

"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great 
and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of 
the Answer!" 

Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd. 

"Never again," cried the man, "never again will we wake up in the 
morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it 
really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? 

For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple 
answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and 
Everything!" 

As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding 
through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows 
on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the 
speaker was addressing the crowd. 

He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through 
towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he 
found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently 
touching it. 

No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is 
hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that the 
whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked 
six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat. 

The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and 
a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly 
every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, 
the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in 



sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been 
constructed yesterday. 

Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and 
waited. 

"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised to 
see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck. The 
word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the 
disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other 
man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck. 

"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this 
program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will 
be the first to hear the computer speak." 

"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur 
suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles. 

"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the 
great question of Life...!" 

"The Universe...!" said Loonquawl. 

"And Everything...!" 

"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought 
is preparing to speak!" 

There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came 
to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off 
experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft 
low hum came from the communication channel. 

"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last. 

"Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, 
"do you have... er, that is..." 

"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. 

I have." 

The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been 
in vain. 

"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg. 

"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought. 

"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and 
Everything?" 

"Yes." 



Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had 
been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those 
who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves 
gasping and squirming like excited children. 

"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl. 

"I am." 

"Now?" 

"Now," said Deep Thought. 

They both licked their dry lips. 

"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to 
like it." 

"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!" 

"Now?" inquired Deep Thought. 

"Yes! Now..." 

"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two 
men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. 

"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought. 

"Tell us!" 

"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great 
Question..." 

"Yes...!" 

"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought. 
"Yes...!" 

"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused. 

"Yes...!" 

"Is..." 

"Yes...!!!...?" 

"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm. 




Chapter 28 


It was a long time before anyone spoke. 

Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense 
expectant faces down in the square outside. 

"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered. 

"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly. 

"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for 
seven and a half million years' work?" 

"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite 
definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with 
you, is that you've never actually known what the question is." 

"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the 
Universe and Everything!" howled Loonquawl. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools 
gladly, "but what actually is it?" 

A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the 
computer and then at each other. 

"Well, you know, it's just Everything... Everything..." offered 
Phouchg weakly. 

"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the 
question actually is, you'll know what the answer means." 

"Oh terrific," muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and 
wiping away a tiny tear. 

"Look, alright, alright," said Loonquawl, "can you just please tell us 
the Question?" 

"The Ultimate Question?" 

"Yes!" 

"Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?" 

"Yes!" 

Deep Thought pondered this for a moment. 



"Tricky," he said. 

"But can you do it?" cried Loonquawl. 

Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. 

Finally: "No," he said firmly. 

Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair. 

"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought. 

They both looked up sharply. 

"Who?" "Tell us!" 

Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp 
begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably 
forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the 
part of whoever had made the recording he assumed. 

"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after 
me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed 
declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational 
parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and yet I will design it for 
you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate 
Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that 
organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you 
yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to 
navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this 
computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be 
called... The Earth." 

Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought. 

"What a dull name," he said and great incisions appeared down the 
length of his body. Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashed 
from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls 
flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own 
ceiling... 

Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires. 

"End of the tape," he explained. 



Chapter 29 


"Zaphod! Wake up!" 

"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?" 

"Hey come on, wake up." 

"Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah?" muttered Zaphod and 
rolled away from the voice back to sleep. 

"Do you want me to kick you?" said Ford. 

"Would it give you a lot of pleasure?" said Zaphod, blearily. 

"No." 

"Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me." Zaphod curled 
himself up. 

"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, 
"two windpipes." 

"And stop talking," said Zaphod, "it's hard enough trying to sleep 
anyway. What's the matter with the ground? It's all cold and hard." 

"It's gold," said Ford. 

With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and 
scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground 
stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed 
like... it's impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in 
the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold 
does. 

"Who put all that there?" yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed. 

"Don't get excited," said Ford, "it's only a catalogue." 

"A who?" 

"A catalogue," said Trillian, "an illusion." 

"How can you say that?" cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and 
knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it with his 
fingernail. It was very heavy and very slightly soft - he could mark it 
with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he 



breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and 
special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. 

"Trillian and I came round a while ago," said Ford. "We shouted 
and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and 
yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep 
us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape." 

Zaphod stared at him bitterly. 

"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good 
dream to show me somebody else's." He sat down in a huff. 

"What's that series of valleys over there?" he said. 

"Hallmark," said Ford. "We had a look." 

"We didn't wake you earlier," said Trillian. "The last planet was 
knee deep in fish." 

"Fish?" 

"Some people like the oddest things." 

"And before that," said Ford, "we had platinum. Bit dull. We 
thought you'd like to see this one though." 

Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. 

"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly. 

In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered 
and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land. 

As with one voice they all went, "Yuch." 

The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny 
yellow and green pebbles - presumably terribly precious stones. The 
mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. 
Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and 
silver tassles. 

In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It 
said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not 
proud. 

And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on 
parachutes. 

In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime 
meadow full of cows. 

"Ow!" said Zaphod. "My brains!" 

"You want to talk about it?" said Ford. 



"Yeah, OK," said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the 
scenes that came and went around them. 

"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did 
it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the 
government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it 
myself. Pretty crazy, right?" 

The other two nodded in agreement. 

"So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know 
it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is I 
don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin 
to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the 
death of President Yooden Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?" 

"Yeah," said Ford, "he was that guy we met when we were kids, the 
Arcturan captain. Fie was a gas. Fie gave us conkers when you bust 
your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid 
he'd ever met." 

"What's all this?" said Trillian. 

"Ancient history," said Ford, "when we were kids together on 
Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the 
bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The 
Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans 
would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates 
before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the 
megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence 
shields known to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and 
huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. 

"One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri-jet 
scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget it, 
it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because 
I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn't want him 
coming back with fake evidence. So what happens? We got in his tri¬ 
jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed 
three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter 
I still don't know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols 
and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a 
year's pocket money. For what? Conkers." 

"The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx," said 
Zaphod. "Fie gave us food, booze - stuff from really weird parts of the 



Galaxy - lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most 
incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the maximum 
security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool guy. Went on 
to become President of the Galaxy." 

Zaphod paused. 

The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark 
mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly 
in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of 
illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough 
people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying 
proposition. 

"Ford," said Zaphod quietly. 

"Yeah?" 

"Just before Yooden died he came to see me." 

"What? You never told me." 

"No." 

"What did he say? What did he come to see you about?" 

"He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should 
steal it." 

"His idea?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and the only possible way of stealing it was 
to be at the launching ceremony." 

Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared 
with laughter. 

"Are you telling me," he said, "that you set yourself up to become 
President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?" 

"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most 
people locked away in a room with soft walls. 

"But why?" said Ford. "What's so important about having it?" 

"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think if I'd consciously known what was so 
important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed 
up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think 
Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away." 

"So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as 
a result of Yooden talking to you?" 

"He was a hell of a talker." 



"Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you 
know." 

Zaphod shrugged. 

"I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?" 
asked Ford. 

Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his 
minds. 

"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of 
my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can understand 
that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat." 

A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from 
beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again. 

They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables 
and design awards. 

A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. 

"The mice will see you now," he said. 



Chapter 30 


"So there you have it," said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and 
perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his 
study. He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't 
think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the 
original pile which promptly fell over. "Deep Thought designed the 
Earth, we built it and you lived on it." 

"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the 
program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly. 

"Yes," said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. 
"Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten 
million years, Earthman... can you conceive of that kind of time span? 
A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in 
that time. Gone." He paused. 

"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added. 

"You know," said Arthur thoughtfully, "all this explains a lot of 
things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling 
that something was going on in the world, something big, even 
sinister, and no one would tell me what it was." 

"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. 
Everyone in the Universe has that." 

"Everyone?" said Arthur. "Well, if everyone has that perhaps it 
means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we 
know..." 

"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too 
excited. "Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always think 
that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly 
remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just 
keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award 
for Norway." 



He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large 
perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded 
into it. 

"Where's the sense in that?" he said. "None that I've been able to 
make out. I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a fleeting moment 
they become fashionable and I get a major award." 

He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside 
carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on something soft. 

"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to 
do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to 
like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a 
lovely baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me it's not equatorial 
enough. Equatorial!" He gave a hollow laugh. "What does it matter? 
Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far 
rather be happy than right any day." 

"And are you?" 

"No. That's where it all falls down of course." 

"Pity," said Arthur with sympathy. "It sounded like quite a good 
lifestyle otherwise." 

Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. 

"Come," said Slartibartfast, "you are to meet the mice. Your arrival 
on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has already 
been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the 
history of the Universe." 

"What were the first two?" 

"Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly. He 
opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow. 

Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, 
at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on 
Thursday morning. 

"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he 
muttered to himself. 

"I beg your pardon?" said the old man mildly. 

"Oh nothing," said Arthur, "only joking." 



Chapter 31 


It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full 
scale of the problem is not always appreciated. 

For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be 
having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole 
opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his 
words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a 
distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the 
brink of frightful interstellar battle. 

The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. 

A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the 
commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle 
shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him 
in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek 
and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric 
death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to 
take back what it had said about his mother. 

The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very 
moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my 
lifestyle drifted across the conference table. 

Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful 
insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible 
war for centuries. 

Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a 
few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a 
ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their 
few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own 
Galaxy - now positively identified as the source of the offending 
remark. 

For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty 
wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they 
came across - which happened to be the Earth - where due to a 



terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally 
swallowed by a small dog. 

Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the 
history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the 
time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. 

"It's just life," they say. 

A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a 
doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting 
room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards. Almost 
immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the 
room and they entered. 

"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. 

"Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good." 

The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to 
see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully 
decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. 
They were stuffing their faces. 

"What happened to you?" demanded Arthur. 

"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our 
hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being 
generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it 
up to us. Here," he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from 
a bowl, "have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet. It's delicious if you happen 
to like that sort of thing." 

"Hosts?" said Arthur. "What hosts? I don't see any..." 

A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch. Earth creature." 

Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped. 

"Ugh!" he said. "There are mice on the table!" 

There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at 
Arthur. 

He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like 
whisky glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced around 
at everyone. 

"Oh!" he said, with sudden realization. "Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite 
prepared for..." 



"Let me introduce you," said Trillian. "Arthur this is Benji mouse." 

"Hi," said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have 
been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass like 
affair, and it moved forward slightly. 

"And this is Frankie mouse." 

The other mouse said, "Pleased to meet you," and did likewise. 

Arthur gaped. 

"But aren't they..." 

"Yes," said Trillian, "they are the mice I brought with me from the 
Earth." 

She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the 
tiniest resigned shrug. 

"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Mega don key?" 
she said. 

Slartibartfast coughed politely. 

"Er, excuse me," he said. 

"Yes, thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji mouse sharply, "you may 
go." 

"What? Oh... er, very well," said the old man, slightly taken aback, 
"Nl just go and get on with some of my fjords then." 

"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It 
looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer." 
He swivelled his pink little eyes. "Not now that we have found a 
native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed." 

"What?" cried Slartibartfast, aghast. "You can't mean that! I've got 
a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!" 

"Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you 
dismantle them," said Frankie, acidly. 

"Skiing holiday!" cried the old man. "Those glaciers are works of art! 
Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic 
ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!" 

"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all." 

"Yes sir," said the old man coldly, "thank you very much. Well, 
goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes 
together." 



With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked 
sadly out of the room. 

Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say. 

"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business." 

Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together. 

"To business!" they said. 

"I beg your pardon?" said Benji. 

Ford looked round. 

"Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast," he said. 

The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports. 
Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved forward to 
address Arthur. 

"Now, Earth creature," he said, "the situation we have in effect is 
this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for 
the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called 
the Ultimate Question." 

"Why?" said Arthur, sharply. 

"No - we already thought of that one," said Frankie interrupting, 
"but it doesn't fit the answer. Why? Forty-Two... you see, it doesn't 
work." 

"No," said Arthur, "I mean why have you been doing it?" 

"Oh, I see," said Frankie. "Well, eventually just habit I think, to be 
brutally honest. And this is more or less the point - we're sick to the 
teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again 
on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me 
the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the 
merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and 
left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated 
our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends." 

"Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension," put in Benji. 

"Since when," continued his murine colleague, "we have had an 
offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and 
lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and 
we're very much inclined to take it." 

"I would, wouldn't you Ford?" said Zaphod promptingly. 

"Oh yes," said Ford, "jump at it, like a shot." 



Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. 

"But we've got to have a product you see," said Frankie, "I mean 
ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other." 

Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. 

"You see," he said, "if they're just sitting there in the studio looking 
very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to 
know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then 
eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two, then the show's 
probably quite short. No follow-up, you see." 

"We have to have something that sounds good," said Benji. 

"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate 
Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?" 

The mice bristled. 

"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes 
the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid 
where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the 
entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly 
being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between 
spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the 
other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do 
with the exercise," said Frankie. 

"But..." started Arthur, hopelessly. 

"Hey, will you get this, Earthman," interrupted Zaphod. "You are a 
last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were 
there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?" 

"Er..." 

"So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate 
configuration of the computer programme," said Ford, rather lucidly 
he thought. 

"Right?" said Zaphod. 

"Well," said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having felt 
an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his 
problems. 

"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right 
over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure of the 
question is encoded in the structure of your brain - so we want to buy 
it off you." 



"What, the question?" said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford and Trillian. 

"For lots of money," said Zaphod. 

"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy." 

"What!" 

"I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically," 
protested Ford. 

"Oh yes," said Frankie, "but we'd have to get it out first. It's got to 
be prepared." 

"Treated," said Benji. 

"Diced." 

"Thank you," shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away 
from the table in horror. 

"It could always be replaced," said Benji reasonably, "if you think 
it's important." 

"Yes, an electronic brain," said Frankie, "a simple one would 
suffice." 

"A simple one!" wailed Arthur. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to 
program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? 
who'd know the difference?" 

"What?" cried Arthur, backing away still further. 

"See what I mean?" said Zaphod and howled with pain because of 
something that Trillian did at that moment. 

"I'd notice the difference," said Arthur. 

"No you wouldn't," said Frankie mouse, "you'd be programmed not 
to." 

Ford made for the door. 

"Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads," he said. "I don't think we've got a 
deal." 

"I rather think we have to have a deal," said the mice in chorus, all 
the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant. With a 
tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the 
table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled 
further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think 
of anything. 



Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him 
towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, 
but Arthur was dead weight - he seemed hypnotized by the airborne 
rodents swooping towards him. 

She screamed at him, but he just gaped. 

With one more yank. Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the 
other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could 
only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they 
ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them 
was also far from pretty. They charged. 

So - Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was 
unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon 
by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than 
they were. 

All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every 
alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din. 



Chapter 32 


"Emergency! Emergency!" blared the klaxons throughout 
Magrathea. "Hostile ship has landed on planet. Armed intruders in 
section 8A. Defence stations, defence stations!" 

The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass 
transports where they lay shattered on the floor. 

"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two 
pounds of Earthling brain." He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes 
flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. 

"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking 
his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question, invent one that 
will sound plausible." 

"Difficult," said Frankie. He thought. "How about What's yellow and 
dangerous?" 

Benji considered this for a moment. 

"No, no good," he said. "Doesn't fit the answer." 

They sank into silence for a few seconds. 

"Alright," said Benji. "What do you get if you multiply six by 
seven?" 

"No, no, too literal, too factual," said Frankie, "wouldn't sustain the 
punters' interest." 

Again they thought. 

Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man 
walk down?" 

"Ah," said Benji. "Aha, now that does sound promising!" He rolled 
the phrase around a little. "Yes," he said, "that's excellent! Sounds 
very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything 
at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, 
excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!" 

They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. 



Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been 
hit about the head with some heavy design awards. 

Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a 
way out. They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They 
glanced about wildly. 

"Which way do you reckon Zaphod?" said Ford. 

"At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off down 
to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the others 
started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt 
that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small 
section of adjacent wall. 

A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. 
We've got you covered." 

"Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to 
try a guess at all. Ford?" 

"OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran down a 
gangway between two computer banks. 

At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and 
space-suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun. 

"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. 

"Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap 
between two data process units. 

The others swerved in behind him. 

"There are two of them," said Trillian. "We're cornered." 

They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large 
computer data bank and the wall. 

They held their breath and waited. 

Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops 
opened fire on them simultaneously. 

"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, 
"I thought they said they didn't want to do that." 

"Yeah, I thought they said that," agreed Ford. 

Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. 

"Hey," he said, "I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us!" 
and ducked again. 

They waited. 



After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!" 

"What did he say?" whispered Ford in astonishment. 

"He said it isn't easy being a cop." 

"Well surely that's his problem isn't it?" 

"I'd have thought so." 

Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems 
on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying 
your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!" 

Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. 

"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not 
dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low 
hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of 
intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us 
socially! I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then 
bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some 
cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and 
then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!" 

"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't 
had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean 
mood!" 

Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these 
guys?" he said. 

"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were 
shooting." 

"So are you going to come quietly," shouted one of the cops again, 
"or are you going to let us blast you out?" 

"Which would you prefer?" shouted Ford. 

A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt 
after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of 
them. 

The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity. 

When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad 
the echoes died away. 

"You still there?" called one of the cops. 

"Yes," they called back. 

"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. 



"We could tell," shouted Ford. 

"Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!" 

"Why?" shouted BackZaphod. 

"Because," shouted the cop, "it's going to be very intelligent, and 
quite interesting and humane! Now either you all give yourselves up 
now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course 
because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up 
this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our 
way out here!" 

"But that's crazy!" cried Trillian. "You wouldn't do that!" 

"Oh yes we would," shouted the cop, "wouldn't we?" he asked the 
other one. 

"Oh yes, we'd have to, no question," the other one called back. 

"But why?" demanded Trillian. 

"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an 
enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and 
everything!" 

"I just don't believe these guys," muttered Ford, shaking his head. 

One cop shouted to the other, "Shall we shoot them again for a 
bit?" 

"Yeah, why not?" 

They let fly another electric barrage. 

The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank 
was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, 
and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back 
towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and 
waited for the end. 



Chapter 33 


But the end never came, at least not then. 

Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence 
afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds. 

The four stared at each other. 

"What happened?" said Arthur. 

"They stopped," said Zaphod with a shrug. 

"Why?" 

"Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?" 

"No." 

They waited. 

"Hello?" called out Ford. 

No answer. 

"That’s odd." 

"Perhaps it's a trap." 

"They haven't the wit." 

"What were those thuds?" 

"Dunno." 

They waited for a few more seconds. 

"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look." 

He glanced round at the others. 

"Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" 
They all shook their heads. 

"Oh well," he said, and stood up. 

For a moment, nothing happened. 

Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford 
peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning 
computer. 

Cautiously he stepped out into the open. 



Still nothing happened. 

Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the 
space-suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled 
heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the 
second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen. 

This struck Ford as being extremely odd. 

Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay 
reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly 
still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that 
still dangled from its limp fingers. 

He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. 

The cop was quite clearly dead. 

A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa - he 
was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for 
survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. 

The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared 
unexpectedly to have blown up. 

Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These 
miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main 
computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked 
through the sub-etha. Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances 
other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. 

He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that 
exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably 
simultaneously. 

He called the others over to look. They came, shared his 
astonishment, but not his curiosity. 

"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm 
supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the 
second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting 
computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. 

He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for 
them a few yards away. 

The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to 
Slartibartfast. 



It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument 
panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the 
controls. 

It said, This is probably the best button to press. 



Chapter 34 


The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the 
steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet 
which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. 
Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land. 

R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel 
that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more 
than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely 
variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors 
vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with 
awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this 
equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. 

R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. 

The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited 
them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen 
ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back 
in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important 
business of its own. 

Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. 

Beside it stood another one. 

It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, 
slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of 
varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed 
anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what 
section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds 
should be connected. 

It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship 
whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a 
smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of 
those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one 
can sense when a ship is completely dead. 



Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious - a ship and two 
policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his 
experience the Universe simply didn't work like that. 

The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter 
cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from 
an acute attack of no curiosity. 

Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked, 
he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold 
dust. 

"Marvin!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?" 

"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a 
muffled drone. 

"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. 

"Very depressed." 

"What's up?" 

"I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there." 

"Why," said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, "are 
you lying face down in the dust?" 

"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't 
pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me." 

"No I don't." 

"Yes you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the Universe. 

I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even 
robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go 
away." 

He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the 
opposite direction. 

"That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft. 

"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to it? 
Do you know?" 

"It hated me because I talked to it." 

"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked 
to it?" 

"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged 
myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at 
great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. 



"And what happened?" pressed Ford. 

"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the 
Heart of Gold. 



Chapter 35 


That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years 
between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the 
small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with 
massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner 
discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed 
to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start 
finding out something about it. 

He came across this entry. 

It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to 
pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, 
Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and 
Where phases." 

"For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How 
can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third 
by the question Where shall we have lunch?" 

He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life. 

"Hey Earthman? You hungry kid?" said Zaphod's voice. 

"Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose," said Arthur. 

"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the 
Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly 
what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear 
and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 

There is another theory which states that this has already 
happened. 



Chapter 1 


The story so far: 

In the beginning the Universe was created. 

This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded 
as a bad move. 

Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, 
though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire 
Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the 
Great Green Arkleseizure. 

The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The 
Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures 
with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the 
only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before 
the wheel. 

However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely 
accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling 
place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. 

For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings 
once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought 
to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of 
Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and 
calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact 
Forty-two-and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to 
find out what the actual question was. 

And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it 
was frequently mistaken for a planet - especially by the strange ape¬ 
like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were 
simply part of a gigantic computer program. 

And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious 
piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could 
possibly make the slightest bit of sense. 



Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the 
Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so 
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of 
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. 

Or so it would seem. 

Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived. 

Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend 
of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in 
the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto 
claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying 
saucers. 

Tricia McMillian - or Trillian - had skipped the planet six months 
earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. 

Two survivors. 

They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever 
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer 
of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is 
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is 
moving slowly towards them. 



Chapter 2 


Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much 
designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices 
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the 
looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier 
things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. 

In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would 
have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is 
precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will 
not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you 
that you will wish you had never been born - or (if you are a clearer 
minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. 

In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once. They 
are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking 
is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the 
Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, 
misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about 
them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like 
generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very 
angry. 

One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished - particularly 
this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons - this job. 

This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic 
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of 
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth. 

He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy 
seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of 
Gold was being systematically scanned. 

It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite 
Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship 
ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, 
had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. 



It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and 
though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both 
him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. 

He had other fish to fry. 

It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and 
corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and 
this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words 
"integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and 
when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he 
reached for the rule book and threw it away. 

In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that 
therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his 
professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said 
bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been 
glossed over. 

He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. 

"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the 
line." 

Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the 
screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years 
away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in 
the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently 
referred to him as "my private brain care specialist" there was not a 
lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was 
employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do 
some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy's most prominent and 
successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were 
quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that 
the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. 

"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how 
are we feeling today?" 

The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped 
out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. 

Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant. 



"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a 
Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the 
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence." 

"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say." 

"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly normal 
behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both very well 
adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of 
the mission?" 

"We have located the ship." 

"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?" 

"The Earthman is there." 

"Excellent! And...?" 

"A female from the same planet. They are the last." 

"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?" 

"The man Prefect." 

"Yes?" 

"And Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered. 

"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most 
regrettable." 

"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the 
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. 

"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not 
make personal friends." 

"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." 

"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack." 

He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned 
slightly. 

"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most 
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams of 
analysts." 

He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. 

"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?" 

"Yes." 

"Good. Destroy the ship immediately." 



"What about Beeblebrox?" 

"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?" 

He vanished from the screen. 

The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which 
connected him with the remains of his crew. 

"Attack," he said. 

At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin 
swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would go 
for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, 
whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and 
stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the 
Improbability factors with a pencil. 

The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful 
and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, 
provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you 
wanted it to do would ever happen. 

He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching 
it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. 

He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except 
that it seemed a fun thing to be. 

He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that 
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He 
wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away 
because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange 
thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect 
him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which 
was to have a wonderfully good time. 

At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had 
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. 

"Starpox!" he shouted. 

At that same precise moment. Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was 
not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial gravity field, 
but because he was leaping down the stair-well which led to the 
ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and 
he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor 



sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the 
corner, burst into Zaphod's door and explained what was on his mind. 

"Vogons," he said. 

A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in 
search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a 
great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only source of hot 
drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment 
produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri- 
Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. 

It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally 
matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. 
When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup 
filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea. 

He attempted to reason with the thing. 

"Tea," he said. 

"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet 
another cup of the sickly liquid. 

He threw it away. 

"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with 
another one. 

"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers 
the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only 
part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent 
years. 

The motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high illuminated 
letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. 
Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, 
the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly 
half their length through the offices of many talented young 
complaints executives - now deceased. 

The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local 
language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer 
illuminated, except at times of special celebration. 

Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. 



"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any 
drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same 
undrinkable stuff?" 

"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine. 
"Share and Enjoy." 

"It tastes filthy!" 

"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the 
machine, "why not share it with your friends?" 

"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try to 
comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink..." 

"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually tailored to 
meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?" 

"Share and Enjoy." 

"Oh shut up." 

"Will that be all?" 

Arthur decided to give up. 

"Yes," he said. 

Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up. 

"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of 
tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen." 

And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about 
China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in 
the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer 
afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the 
tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the 
history of the East India Company. 

"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished. 

"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want." 

"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?" 

"Er, yes. With milk." 

"Squirted out of a cow?" 

"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose..." 



"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine 
tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it 
now meant business. 

"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur. 

"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him. 

It summoned up the ship's computer. 

"Hi there!" said the ship's computer. 

The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The 
computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and 
together they lapsed into a grim silence. 

Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further 
happened. 

He thumped it, but still nothing happened. 

Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. 

In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around 
it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly 
yellow lump of the Vogon ship. 



Chapter 3 


"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the 
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the 
computer to talk to her. Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking 
it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen. 

He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to 
them. 

"Hello?" he said. 

At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble 
surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the 
conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands and 
he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed 
and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. 

"Something up?" said Arthur. 

"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the 
manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey 
spoke!" 

The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut 
out. 

"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, 

"a talking monkey!" 

"If you're upset about something..." said Arthur. 

"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!" 

Arthur gibbered. 

"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!" 

"Can't. Computer's jammed." 

"Jammed?" 

"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere in 
the ship." 

Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve 
across his forehead and slumped back against the wall. 



"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. 

When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had 
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all 
good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in 
important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a 
peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep 
up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass 
and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly 
to his mind at this moment. 

A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping 
up across his cheeks and heating his brow. 

He started to speak, and stopped. 

He started to speak again and stopped again. 

Finally he managed to speak. 

"Er," he said. He cleared his throat. 

"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all 
turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on 
the vision screen. 

"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was occupying 
it? I just ask out of interest..." 

Their eyes were riveted on him. 

"And, er... well that's it really, just asking." 

Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. 

"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed. 

"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a short 
while ago it was trying to work out how to..." 

"Yes?" 

"Make me some tea." 

"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping 
with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you in a 
while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer 
intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. 

As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start 
firing. 



The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force- 
shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a 
dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it 
wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect 
gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he said a short while later. 

"Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. Fie flicked 
idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look. 

"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty 
seconds." 

"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod. 

"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five seconds." 

Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. Fie had 
expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor 
beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub- 
Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Fleart of Gold's Infinite 
Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle 
as the Fleart of Gold just sat there and took it. 

A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to 
blaze away at the Fleart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it. 

Fie tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle 
trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found. 

Fie didn't know about the tea of course. 

Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Fleart of Gold 
were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they 
had left to spend. 

Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a 
seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on. 

Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as 
something to be avoided than harped upon. 

Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of 
being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that 
they might just feel the same way about him and, what's more, be 
able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion. 



Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that 
occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had 
inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. 

"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford. 

"Yeah." 

"Does it have to be now?" 

The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was 
rising. The light was getting dimmer - all the energy the computer 
didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the 
rapidly fading force-field. 

"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to 
help us." 

"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care." 

"Suggest something else we can do." 

"Er, well..." 

"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian, 
Monkeyman, move." 

They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down 
and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third hand 
Zaphod turned off the lights. 

Darkness gripped the ship. 

Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued to 
rip at the force-field. 

"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name." 

"What is it?" asked Arthur. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth." 

"What?" 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!" 

"The Fourth?" 

"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod 
Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the 
Third..." 

"What?" 

"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. 
Now concentrate!" 



"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect. 

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?" 

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say? 

The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a 
far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring 
all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his 
own. 

Round the central console four figures hunched in tight 
concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying 
shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. 

They concentrated. 

Still they concentrated. 

And still they concentrated. 

The seconds ticked by. 

On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, 
then of frustration and finally of embarrassment. 

At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from 
Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch. 

"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on," said a 
voice. "No, not too bright please, my eyes aren't what they once 
were." 

Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their 
heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try 
and stay in the same place. 

"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt 
figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His 
two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they 
might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One 
lolled in sleep, but the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes 
weren't what they once were, they must once have been diamond 
cutters. 

Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. Fie gave the intricate 
little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of 
familial respect. 

"Oh... er, hi Great Granddad..." he breathed. 



The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered 
through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great 
grandson. 

"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth." 

"The First." 

"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It always 
seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of 
what he liked to think of as his soul. 

He shifted awkwardly in his seat. 

"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look. I'm really sorry about the 
flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was 
fresh out of wreaths and..." 

"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Well..." 

"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the 
same." 

"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper. 

Zaphod fidgeted nervously. 

"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to my 
great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this..." 

"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to himself. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what. I'll go and see 
her. But first we've just got to..." 

"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod 
Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Ah. Oh." 

"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod..." 

"Yeah well..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this 
conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told him that the 
seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had 
reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur's faces 
white and unblinking in the gloom. 

"Er, Great Grandfather..." 

"We've been following your progress with considerable 
despondency..." 



"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see..." 

"Not to say contempt!" 

"Could you sort of listen for a moment..." 

"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?" 

"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an 
exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the 
basic point of the exercise across. 

"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure with a 
shrug. 

"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod feverishly. 

The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had 
brought in and looked at it with interest. 

"Er... Great Granddad..." 

"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with 
a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very slight 
eccentricy in its orbit?" 

Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on 
what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. 

"Er, no... look," he said. 

"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the 
cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger at 
Zaphod. 

"Your fault!" he screeched. 

"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands. 

"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because..." 

"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat. 

"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise..." 

"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly 
grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed. 

"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your..." the 
ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, "with your disreputable 
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have 
done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no. Too busy. 
Too modern. Too sceptical - till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a 
fix and come over suddenly all astrally-minded!" 



He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of 
the other one, which was already becoming restive. 

"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll have 
to think about this one." 

"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously. 

"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said. 

"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got left 
to live." 

"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't 
apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of 
the bridge in search of something else to poke around at. 

Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and 
wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it. 

"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still alive, 
and we are about to lose our lives." 

"Good job too." 

"What?" 

"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've 
made of it the phrase 'pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind." 

"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!" 

"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for a 
Beeblebrox?" 

"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!" 

"Conceited little megapuppy." 

Zaphod blinked in bewilderment. 

"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather." 

The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and 
tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding 
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a thing. 

"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. 
You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and it 
gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a 
saying up here. 'Life is wasted on the living.'" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I 
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads." 



"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect. 

"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Oh yes." 

"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in fact 
help us?" 

"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod. 

Ford nodded despondently. 

"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the 
Galaxy for a reason. Flave you forgotten?" 

"Could we go into this later?" 

"Flave you forgotten!" insisted the ghost. 

"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain 
when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full of tricksy 
ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a 
fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit 
throats." 

"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!" 

Fie paused for a moment. 

"Good," he said and the noise stopped. 

"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. Fie looked again at his watch and 
tapped it. Fie looked up. 

"Fley, the noise has stopped," he said. 

A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes. 

"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment 
you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say." 

"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod 
leaping out of his chair, "A - thanks for stopping time and all that, 
great, terrific, wonderful, but B - no thanks for the homily, right? I 
don't know what this great think I'm meant to be doing is, and it looks 
to me as if I was supposed not to know. And I resent that, right? 

"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except 
that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own 
brain - my own brain - and locked off the bits that knew and cared, 
because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I wouldn't be 



able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able to steal this ship, 
which must be the important thing. 

"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by 
changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its own 
choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve 
not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. 
That's what he wanted, that's what he got. 

"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, 
leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well, I don't 
want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my choice. I'm 
not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my own." 

Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded 
looks he was attracting. 

"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead shouldn't 
hang about trying to interfere with the living!" 

"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the 
ghost. 

"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different isn't 
it?" 

He grinned at Trillian, weakly. 

"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste 
my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use for it." 

"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is. 
Try me." 

"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did 
Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. 
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, 
with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must find 
- the man who controls this Galaxy, and - we suspect - others. 
Possibly the entire Universe." 

"Why?" 

"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you 
lad, does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?" 

"It's alright." 

The old ghost glowered at him. 



"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this 
Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. You will do it. Don't 
think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field controls 
you, you are in its grip. What's this?" 

He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the 
Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him. 

"What's it doing?" 

"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea." 

"Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now Zaphod, 
"he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't know if you are 
really capable of succeeding in your job. I think you will not be able to 
avoid it. However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as 
I did. The principal reason I am helping you now is that I couldn't bear 
the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. 
Understood?" 

"Yeah, thanks a bundle." 

"Oh, and Zaphod?" 

"Er, yeah?" 

"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, 
need a hand out of a tight corner..." 

"Yeah?" 

"Please don't hesitate to get lost." 

Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the 
wizened old ghost's hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the 
bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold leapt an 
unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space. 



Chapter 4 


Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several 
notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed 
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the 
final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away, and the 
ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. 

Good, he thought. 

The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had 
ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. 

The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and 
subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the 
Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and 
Everything, he thought. 

There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in 
the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and 
highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the Meaning 
of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, 
he thought. 

"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as the 
smoke began to clear. 

He paused, then looked about. 

"Where's Zaphod?" he said. 

Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and 
shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was. 

"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?" 

A moment later he said: 

"Where's Marvin?" 

The robot's corner was empty. 



The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it 
rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead, every vision screen 
was dead. They consulted the computer. It said: 

"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all communication. 
Meanwhile, here is some light music." 

They turned off the light music. 

They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment 
and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any 
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. 

One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the 
Nutri-Matic machine was located. 

On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a 
small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone 
china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever 
tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait". 



Chapter 5 


Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in 
the known Universe. 

Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of 
wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can 
hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing 
magazine headlined an article with the words "When you are tired of 
Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the suicide rate quadrupled 
overnight. 

Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. 

It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat 
suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-tropical 
coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is 
nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. 

No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the 
dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time 
attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round 
swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form the Galactic 
Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal anomaly". 

There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a 
city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground 
there than elsewhere. 

If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way of 
approaching it, no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly they don't 
want to see you in Light City - you will see why it has this name. Here 
the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, 
shimmering on the white, palm-lined boulevards, glistening on the 
healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the 
villas, the hazy airpads, the beach bars and so on. 

Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building 
consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected by a bridge 
half-way up their length. 



The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the 
proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the 
book's editors and a breakfast cereal company. 

The book is a guide book, a travel book. 

It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, 
books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa 
Minor - more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and Fifty, 
better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View by 
Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six) and 
more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest blockbusting title 
Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been 
Forced To Find Out. 

(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern 
Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great Encyclopaedia 
Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for 
though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, 
or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older and more 
pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, 
and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC printed in large friendly 
letters on its cover.) 

It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to 
see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan 
Dollars a day - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the 
Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up 
with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass 
along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden 
colour of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the 
mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it 
was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the 
giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight 
hours, in other words continuously. 

If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter 
the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes 
where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's 
relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very 
few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon - it 



enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind 
it lie the night clubs. 

If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime - call it 
what you will - you had approached the second pavement cafe on the 
right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-Betans chatting, 
drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's 
watches to see how expensive they were. 

You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking 
hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan 
Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. 
They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of 
the Hitchhiker's Guide building itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost 
the equivalent of over sixty Altairan dollars. 

"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly. 

If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one 
you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very 
startled and confused. 

The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had 
been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold. 

"Absolute sell out," said the voice again. 

Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two 
dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? 

How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of 
the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. 
They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. 

"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place like 
this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!" 

Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And 
why? 

He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same 
pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. 
He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where 
had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the 
sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched 
one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with 
them on. They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic 
Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help 



people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of 
trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing 
anything that might alarm you. 

Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a 
little bit. 

The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously 
expensive fruit juice. 

"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa 
Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've even 
heard that they've created a whole electronically synthesized 
Universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories 
during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and 
evening mean much in this place." 

Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was 
now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing, but 
why? 

Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was 
very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these 
thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They 
were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts 
of his mind. 

He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He 
ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in 
to it. 

What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired, 
confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the thought 
meant. 



Chapter 6 


"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of 
the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large pink-winged 
insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome 
expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at 
all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and 
leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of 
keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging 
round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that it had read 
something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging 
round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them seemed to come 
and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in 
extremely dirty spaceports. And all they ever did was complain. It 
shivered its wings. 

"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to 
Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now. He's 
on an intergalactic cruise." 

It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was 
angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed 
the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to 
interrupt an important phone call. 

"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an 
intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed down 
the phone. 

"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to 
complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of 
misinformation contained in the book. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion 
to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex 



and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or 
informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim, 
that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate. In cases 
of major discrepancy it's always reality that's got it wrong. 

This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is definitive. 
Reality is frequently inaccurate." 

This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when 
the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had 
died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said 
"Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting 
tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very 
good meal of visiting tourists") they claimed that the first version of 
the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a 
qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth 
beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself 
for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in 
a moving speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and 
duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to 
enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect 
receptionist. 

"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop." 

"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be 
addressed in this manner. 

"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now." 

"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could be a 
little cool about it..." 

Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly 
cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month. I am so hip 
I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before you 
blow it?" 

"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the most 
petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid that isn't 
possible right now as Mr. Zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise." 

Hell, thought Zaphod. 

"When he's going to be back?" he said. 

"Back sir? He's in his office." 



Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in 
his mind. He didn't succeed. 

"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?" He leaned 
forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. 

"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get 
stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal." 

"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect 
quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?" 

"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp. 

The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. 

"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want one." 

"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?" 

"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six 
packs?" 

The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. 

"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio report. It 
said that you were dead..." 

"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving yet. 
Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?" 

"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but..." 

"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to 
him." 

"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical People 
Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir..." 

Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr. Zarniwoop?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I told 
myself I had to." 

"Come again sir?" 

Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally. 

"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he said, "as 
a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather. No 
sooner had I got there that my former self, the one that operated on 



my brain, popped into my head and said 'Go see Zarniwoop'. I have 
never heard of the cat. That is all I know. That and the fact that I've 
got to find the man who rules the Universe." 

He winked. 

"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so 
weird you should be in movies." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, 

"and you, baby, should be in real life." 

The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and 
then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone. 

A metal hand restrained it. 

"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that 
would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse 
in tears. 

This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots. 

"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" 

"I doubt it," said Marvin. 

"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me..." Six of the phones were 
now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's attention. 

"No one can help me," intoned Marvin. 

"Yes, sir, well..." 

"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand fell 
limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very slightly. 

"Is that so," said the insect tartly. 

"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?" 

"I'm sorry, sir, if..." 

"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot 
if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?" 

"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be 
able to drag itself out of this conversation. 

"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it. 

"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal..." 

"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?" 

The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its 
eyes and darted back again. 



"Is it worth it?" it asked. 

"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately. 

"What... do... you... want?" 

"I'm looking for someone." 

"Who?" hissed the insect. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there." 

The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. 

"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed. 

"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin. 

"What!" 

"Pathetic isn't it?" 

With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught 
up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod span round in 
astonishment. 

"Hey... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?" 

Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. 

"I don't know," he said. 

"But..." 

"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and 
the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable. An 
Improbability Field I expect." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you along 
to keep me company." 

"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath. 

"So, how are you?" he said aloud. 

"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which 
personally I don't." 

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened. 

"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for this 
trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices. If you enjoy your ride, 
which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience 
some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the 
offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the 



Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, 
sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do besides 
talk?" 

"I go up," said the elevator, "or down." 

"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up." 

"Or down," the elevator reminded him. 

"Yeah, OK, up please." 

There was a moment of silence. 

"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully. 

"Oh yeah?" 

"Super." 

"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?" 

"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most 
reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down 
might offer you?" 

Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't 
need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. 
He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he 
would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying 
on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of 
experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was 
his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something 
passionate on the subject of food. 

One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man 
who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as 
well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be someone else. 
Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing 
with an elevator. 

"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily. 

"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's the 
basement, the microfiles, the heating system... er..." 

It paused. 

"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are 
alternatives." 



"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist 
elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall. 

"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat. 

"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's afraid." 

"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's 
afraid of heights?" 

"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future..." 

"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing 
want, a pension scheme?" 

At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall 
behind them. From the walls around them came the sound of 
suddenly active machinery. 

"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what 
sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming." 

Zaphod looked out of the elevator - an agitated crowd had 
gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting. 

Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast. 

He ducked back in. 

"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've got 
to get to Zarniwoop." 

"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully. 

"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better have 
a very good reason for me wanting to see him." 

Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient 
electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as 
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical 
People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west 
wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. 

This is because they operate on the curios principle of "defocused 
temporal perception". In other words they have the capacity to see 
dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on 
the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, 
thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends 
that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators. 



Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and 
precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of 
going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the 
notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded 
participation in the decision-making process and finally took to 
squatting in basements sulking. 

An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star 
system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for 
neurotic elevators. 

At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly. 

"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember. I'm only doing this 
because I like your robot." 

Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly 
snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would 
take it. 

Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent 
and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the doors 
that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked. 

They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one 
tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the 
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced 
small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. 

"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at 
his least jaunty. 

They both stood and looked in both directions. 

"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin. 

"More that you can possibly imagine." 

"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said. 

It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet - and 
another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more 
vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. 

Zaphod looked at the floor. 

"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro 
system for toning up your muscles while you work, or..." 



He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because 
at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive 
sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the 
window with a sharp buzz. 

Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building 
shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window. 

"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!" 

Another roar cracked through the building. 

"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?" 
asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that 
moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to 
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized, but 
the only one he could think of. 

Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from 
this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man. The 
man saw him. 

"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. 

Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the 
building. 

"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?" 

"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. 

"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just 
generally well disposed of people?" 

The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his 
feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and weatherbeaten 
and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice round the Galaxy and 
back with him in them. 

"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your 
building's being bombed?" 

The man indicated his awareness. 

It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to 
see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green spacecraft 
crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. 

"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed 
the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters." 

"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!" 



"You get the picture?" 

"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard 
someone talk about them when he was President, but he never paid 
much attention to official matters. 

The man was pulling him back through a door. Fie went with him. 
With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot through the 
air and disappeared down the corridor. 

"What was that?" hissed Zaphod. 

"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man. 

"Hey yeah?" 

"Get down!" 

From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like object. 
It zapped past them. 

"And that was...?" 

"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you." 

"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air. 

"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you." 

"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?" 

From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic 
black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and 
shape of a tank. 

"Holy photon, what's that?" 

"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get 
you." 

"Should we leave?" 

"I think we should." 

"Marvin!" called Zaphod. 

"What do you want?" 

Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and 
looked at them. 

"You see that robot coming towards us?" 

Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards 
them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. 
He looked back up at the tank. 

"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said. 



"Yeah." 

"Whilst you save your skins." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!" 

"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand." 

The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off 
down the corridor. 

A point occurred to him about this. 

"Where are we going?" he said. 

"Zarniwoop's office." 

"Is this any time to keep an appointment?" 

"Come on." 



Chapter 7 


Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a 
particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty 
sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building 
was still undergoing. 

He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank 
rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. 
The probe withdrew. 

Marvin stood there. 

"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank. 

"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop you." 

The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. 

"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!" 

"No, really I have," said Marvin simply. 

"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief. 

"Guess," said Marvin. 

The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized 
electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and 
forwards in consternation. 

"Guess?" said the tank. 

Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, 
down a second and along a third. The building continued to rock and 
judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building 
up, why was it taking so long? 

With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous 
unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and 
they fell inside. 

All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-lying-on- 
the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A single chair, a 
single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The 



desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary form 
of paper clip, was empty. 

"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already 
tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip. 

"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man. 

Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a 
barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to 
running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and 
making cryptic remarks in empty offices. 

"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and 
this is my towel." 

"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod. 

"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty 
old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by the 
corner. 

Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green 
spaceships growled past. 

"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll never 
guess." 

"Errmmm..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed 
thought, "laser beams?" 

Marvin shook his head solemnly. 

"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too 
obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded. 

"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin. 

"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er... how about 
an electron ram?" 

This was new to Marvin. 

"What's that?" he said. 

"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm. 

From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal 
blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of 
dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. 

"No," said Marvin, "not one of those." 

"Good though, isn't it?" 



"Very good," agreed Marvin. 

"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment's 
consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic Re-Structron 
Destabilized Zenon Emitters!" 

"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin. 

"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe. 

"No," said Marvin. 

"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be..." 

"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're failing 
to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship 
between men and robots." 

"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it..." it tailed off into 
thought again. 

"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, 
to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off 
to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?" 

"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty 
damn devastating I should expect." 

"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave 
me to protect myself with shall I." 

"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself. 

"Nothing," said Marvin. 

There was a dangerous pause. 

"Nothing?" roared the battle machine. 

"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic 
sausage." 

The machine heaved about with fury. 

"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing, eh? 
Just don't think, do they?" 

"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in 
all the diodes down my left side." 

"Makes you spit, doesn't it?" 

"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling. 

"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll 
smash that wall down!" 



The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and 
took out the wall next to the machine. 

"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly. 

"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered. 

"Yes," said Marvin. 

"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the tank. 

It took out the ceiling of the bridge. 

"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin. 

"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take 
out this floor too, no trouble!" 

It took out the floor, too. 

"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys 
and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. 

"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged 
away. 



Chapter 8 


"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do 
these guys out here want?" 

"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the 
Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy." 

"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first." 

"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the 
window." 

Zaphod looked, and gaped. 

"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the 
ground?" 

"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne." 

Clouds streaked past the office window. 

Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green 
Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A 
network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in 
a firm grip. 

Zaphod shook his head in perplexity. 

"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a building, 
they take it away." 

"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta, "it's 
what you're going to do." 

"Well don't I get a say in that?" 

"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast and 
bumpy journey." 

"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't 
know what's hit me." 

Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, 
slumped in a corner and switched himself off. 



On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared at 
the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's eyes as she 
looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the rack. 

Finally he saw it. 

He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board 
that lay just in front of the rack. 

The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He 
laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. 

"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot I'm 
afraid." 

The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th 
time. 

Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. 

Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he 
stalked the ship thumping dead instruments. 

Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought. 

Why did it rock and sway? 

Why could he not find out where they were? 

Where, basically, were they? 

The left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices 
streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either 
before or since by any other office block in the Universe. 

In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily. 

Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel 
maintenance. 

"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded 
Zaphod. 

"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the 
Universe." 

"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod. 

"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about 
whether they got food?" 

"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar." 



Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light 
of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably 
the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this speed, space 
itself was invisible, and indeed unreal. 

"Flere, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel. 

Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his 
forehead on a small spring. 

"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta. 

"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod. 

"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin 
B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm 
extracts." 

Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement. 

"What are the brown stains?" he asked. 

"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm." 

Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully. 

Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. Fie spat it out again. 

"Ugh," he stated. 

"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually need 
to suck the other end a bit too." 

"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?" 

"Anti-depressants," said Roosta. 

"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing it 
back. 

Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked 
round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up. 

"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have 
you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?" 

"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully. 

"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total 
Perspective Vortex!" 

Zaphod had never heard of this. Fie believed that he had heard of 
all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total 
Perspective Vortex was not fun. Fie asked what it was. 



"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent 
being can undergo." 

Zaphod nodded a resigned nod. 

"So," he said, "no food, huh?" 

"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, 
break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a 
man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest 
of your life!" 

"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod sharply. 

"This is worse." 

"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed. 

"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added 
a moment later. 

"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever. 

They know what you're after." 

"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?" 

"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to 
meet the man who rules the Universe." 

"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added: 

"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't worry 
about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook." 

Roosta sighed heavily. 

"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all 
this got to so with you?" 

"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with 
Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great 
grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox." 

"Me?" 

"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how much." 

"But..." 

"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you." 

"What job, man, what are you talking about?" 

"I will do it before I leave you." 

Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence. 

Zaphod was terribly glad. 



Chapter 9 


The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale 
and unwholesome. 

The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over 
salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the 
crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. 
The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had 
long been deserted. 

The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the 
old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped 
about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here 
and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers 
lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors 
of the civilization that once lived here. 

The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it 
passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain 
on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. 

This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the 
reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From 
without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From 
within it was something more monstrous than the mind can 
comprehend. 

About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a 
pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable 
was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of 
sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the 
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings. 

Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that 
was waiting for something. 

The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a 
distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. 



The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of 
Frogstar World B. 

As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable 
silence that had grown up between the two men. 

He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said: 

"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do." 

Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner 
sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, 
do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window." 

"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing 
from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it. 

Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already locked 
it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. 

Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other 
wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force 
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, 
an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar 
World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than 
the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex. 

Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the 
silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He 
felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He 
felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he 
ought to get whatever it was over with. 

He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split 
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some 
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he 
thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through 
all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, 
then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got 
the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, 
and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was 
surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of 
the world outside. 



Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he 
saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth 
floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five degrees, but 
still the descent looked heart-stopping. 

Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks 
that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and 
clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin 
followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully 
down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. 

As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes 
smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin. 

The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the sort 
of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information," did 
little to improve his state of mind. 

About half-way down the side of the shattered building they 
stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear 
and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. 
Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just seemed cheerful 
in comparison with his own mood. 

A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly 
settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed 
on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded 
its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. 

Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head 
and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak 
underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its wings the 
vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen. 

In fact, it looked almost human. 

It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a 
desultory fashion. 

"Go away," said Zaphod. 

"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust 
again. 

Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. 

"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He was 
quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in 
fact hallucinating. 



"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 

"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear. 

Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly 
caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a 
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, 
breathing heavily. 

The voice had no visible source whatever - there was no one there. 
Nevertheless, it spoke again. 

"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight." 

Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In 
other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There is, 
however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied 
voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, 
not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed 
building. 

"Hey, er..." he stammered. 

"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly. 

"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?" 

"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am 
the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex." 

"Why can't I see..." 

"You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated," 
the voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to your left. Why don't 
you try it?" 

Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading 
all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself 
across to them. 

"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his ear, 
and as it spoke it faded. 

"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you..." 

"It'll only take a couple of minutes..." said the voice very faintly. 

"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly 
next to him, "Did a... did a voice just..." 

"Yes," Marvin replied tersely. 

Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. 
They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the 



unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find 
his way down the building more comfortably if he didn't actually have 
to look at what he was doing. 

Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled 
foundations of the building and, once more removing his sunglasses, 
he dropped to the ground. 

Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the 
dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to 
move. 

"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear, 
"excuse me leaving you like that, it's just that I have a terrible head 
for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did have a terrible head for 
heights." 

Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had 
missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, 
however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the 
encircling buildings. 

"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?" 

"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but 
it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see." After what 
seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with 
bodies." 

Zaphod wasn't sure about this. 

"I thought I did," he said. 

"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice, "the 
way it's been living recently it must be on its last elbows." 

"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?" 

The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. 
He didn't know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing. 
Then the voice spoke again. 

"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?" 

"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, 
"this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take in a 
look at the local scenery, you know?" 

"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr. 

"Er, no." 



Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one 
of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view. 

He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. 

"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then." 

"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must 
come. Follow me." 

"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?" 

"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming." 

A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that 
seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by listening very 
carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it 
was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else 
was there to do? 



Chapter 10 


The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big 
place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to 
ignore. 

Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their 
own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do. 

For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the 
large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population of 
which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree. In 
which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative 
articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the 
importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and 
eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less 
accessible outer branches. 

In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those 
who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether 
any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or 
indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions 
brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. 

Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the 
Galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is 
why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is. 

For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one 
momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, 
and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a 
microscopic dot, which says "You are here." 

The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. 
The wind whipped wildly over it. 

Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, 
gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total 
Perspective Vortex. 



As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of 
terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his 
body. It screamed above the wind and died away. 

Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid 
helium. 

"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. 

"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the 
Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude." 

"Hey, it really sounds bad..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we 
maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?" 

"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at 
one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only 
get in the way. Hey ho." 

"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay 
whatever it was that was going to happen to him. 

"Well, it's... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly. 

"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod. 

There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke 
again. 

"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark in 
rather poor taste." 

Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. 

"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know." 

The voice fluttered unhappily. 

"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was trying 
very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we are currently 
undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in 
divorce." 

The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to 
say. He mumbled uncertainly. 

"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr 
again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. 
We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. 

Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, 
as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It 
won't even see me..." 



He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. 

"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to 
inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec 
remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and so we left it. It will 
probably get custody of my forename." 

"Oh..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?" 

"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all 
really doesn't it?" 

"Errr..." said Zaphod sympathetically. 

"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job. Custodian 
of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground 
of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex - they don't really 
count I'm afraid." 

"Ah..." 

"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?" 

"Er..." 

"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet - people, cities 
shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities 
there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought 
necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops 
were increasing. It's a well known economic phenomenon but tragic 
to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more 
shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they 
became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to 
buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, 
until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed 
the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically 
possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result - collapse, 
ruin and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had 
the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds - you've seen 
one of them - who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed 
that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you 
to the Vortex." 

Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward 
across the plain. 

"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?" 



"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar 
World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in the 
evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective 
Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built 
here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep." 

At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod 
shuddered. 

"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed. 

"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite 
Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and 
yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small." 

"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod 
trying to flap the last remnants of his ego. 

Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful 
humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of 
the plain. 

As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a 
small darkened chamber within. 

"Enter," said Gargravarr. 

Zaphod started with fear. 

"Hey, what, now?" he said. 

"Now." 

Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It 
was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one 
man. 

"It... er... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me," said Zaphod. 

"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter." 

With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of 
Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied 
man was not for the moment speaking. 

The elevator began its descent. 

"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this," muttered 
Zaphod. 

"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly. 

"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate." 

"I don't. The Vortex does." 



At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and 
Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber. 

At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large 
enough for a man to stand in. 

It was that simple. 

It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a 
single thick wire. 

"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise. 

"That is it." 

Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod. 

"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod. 

"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do it 
now." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod. 

He opened the door of the box and stepped in. 

Inside the box he waited. 

After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was 
there in the box with him. 



Chapter 11 


The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole 
Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. 

To explain - since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some 
way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in 
theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation - every sun, 
every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and 
social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. 

The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically 
in order to annoy his wife. 

Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker, a 
speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. 

And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate 
amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the 
mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces 
of fairy cake. 

"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as 
often as thirty-eight times in a single day. 

And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her. 

And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated 
from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: 
so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity 
of creation and herself in relation to it. 

To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain 
but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that 
if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it 
cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. 


The door of the Vortex swung open. 



From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had 
rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was 
clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. 

He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. 

Instead, he stepped out. 

"Hi!" he said. 

"Beeblebrox..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement. 

"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod. 

"You... you... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr. 

"You saw me, kid." 

"And it was working?" 

"Sure was." 

"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?" 

"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?" 

Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been 
with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open. 

"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?" 

"Oh, yeah, yeah." 

"But... what did you experience?" 

Zaphod shrugged smugly. 

"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and 
great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!" 

His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and 
suddenly stopped, startled. 

He breathed heavily. 

"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?" 

He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with 
which it was surrounded. 

"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I 
wouldn't have time to eat it." 


He ate it. 



Chapter 12 


A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction 
of the ruined city. 

The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently 
stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning 
to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous. 

The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The 
whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity 
around him - everything. And with it had come the clear and 
extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. 
Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine 
is another. 

He didn't have time to reflect on this matter. 

Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as 
to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent 
interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and 
find somewhere to hide. 

What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was 
the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence 
to believe that something would turn up. 

Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds 
for optimism. 

He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. 

He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny 
weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed 
were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of 
them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. 

After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the 
one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, 
surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the 
remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed 



reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him 
with... well with anything. 

He approached the building. Along one side of it - the front it 
would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area - were three 
gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, 
and towards this, Zaphod ran. 

Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over 
everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, 
part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches 
over the floor. 

Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with 
debris. 

The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, 
sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split 
open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. 

They were all spacecraft, all derelict. 

Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was 
nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the 
mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to 
collapse further into itself. 

Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger 
than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and 
cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod 
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old 
feedline. 

He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered 
that it was still connected to the ship. 

To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also 
humming slightly. 

He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the 
feedline in his hands. 

He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his 
hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it 
connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight 
humming vibration was more distinct. 



His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an 
ear against the ship's side. He could only hear a faint, indeterminate 
noise. 

He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all 
about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non- 
biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude 
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. 

What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. 

The voice said: 

"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for 
the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently awaiting the 
loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for 
your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey. 

Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will 
shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again." 

Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. 

He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he 
suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by 
only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with 
grime, but some of the figures were still discernible. 

Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief 
calculations. His eyes widened. 

"Nine hundred years..." he breathed to himself. That was how late 
the ship was. 

Two minutes later he was on board. 

As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool 
and fresh - the air conditioning was still working. 

The lights were still on. 

He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow 
corridor and stepped nervously down it. 

Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. 

"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess and, 
turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of 
him. 

When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She 
opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through. 



He followed her through the door. 

They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart 
stopped still again for a moment. 

In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. 

The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were 
long, the men wore beards. 

All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping. 

Zaphod had the creeping horrors. 

He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was 
half-way down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other end. 
She turned and spoke. 

"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank 
you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be taking off 
as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will 
serve you coffee and biscuits." 

There was a slight hum. 

At that moment, all the passengers awoke. 

They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support 
systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and 
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter. 

They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up 
the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front 
of each one of them. 

Then one of them rose from his seat. 

He turned and looked at Zaphod. 

Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get 
off. He turned and ran from the bedlam. 

He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. 

The man pursued him. 

He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the 
entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck, 
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the 
door breathing hard. 

Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door. 

From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. 



"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to 
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits are 
being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your 
seat." 

Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand 
continued to knock on the door. 

"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers 
are not allowed on the flight deck." 

"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod. 

"Please return to your seat." 

"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again. 

"Please return to your seat." 

"I am not a... hello, can you hear me?" 

"Please return to your seat." 

You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod. 

"Yes," said the voice from the flight console. 

"You're in charge of this ship?" 

"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers are 
to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their comfort and 
convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served every year, after 
which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their 
continued comfort and convenience. Departure will take place when 
the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay." 

Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had 
now ceased. He approached the flight console. 

"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship? It's a 
wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man. There are no 
lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!" 

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that 
other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon-soaked 
paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to 
your seat." 

"But..." 

But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see 
the man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large 




briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no 
beard and no long fingernails. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe 
you wanted to see me." 

Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He 
dropped into a chair. 

"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said. 

"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone. 

He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. 

"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit nervous 
that you might have left my office by the door rather than the 
window. Then you would have been in trouble." 

Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled. 

"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my 
electronically synthesized Universe," he explained, "if you had left by 
the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one 
works from here." 

He patted the briefcase smugly. 

Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing. 

"What's the difference?" he muttered. 

"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except that I 
think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe." 

"What's going on?" spat Zaphod. 

"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made 
Zaphod seethe. 

"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated 
at which this man could be found - the man who rules the Universe, 
and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability field. 
To protect my secret - and myself - I retreated to the safety of this 
totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise 
liner. I was secure. Meanwhile, you and I..." 

"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?" 

"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well." 

"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence. 

"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the 
Improbability Drive ship - the only one which could reach the ruler's 



world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I trust, and I 
congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted 
to hit with a brick. 

"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this 
Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are 
therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would 
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived the 
Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?" 

"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed. 

"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?" 

"No." 

"Where is your jacket?" 

Zaphod looked at him in mystification. 

"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside." 

"Good, we will go and find it." 

Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him. 

Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of 
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits. 

"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said 
Zarniwoop. 

"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think..." 

Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. 
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in the 
debris. 

"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop, 
"watch." 

As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split, 
it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that Zaphod had 
been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. 

It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its full 
size. 

"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of... oh I don't know, 
but something very large." 

Zaphod swayed. 

"You mean I had it with me all the time?" 

"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. 



He twisted a single switch inside it. 

"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!" 

The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared 
exactly as before. 

"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same." 

"You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all the 
time?" 

"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point." 

"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in you 
can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your own 
games." 

"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined 
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape." 

He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time 
Zaphod hit it. 



Chapter 13 


Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold. 

"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's 
reactivated!" 

Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. 

"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking 
them awake. 

"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be 
back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that..." 

"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are." 

"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on 
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you 
don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am." 

"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the 
floor and not taking any of this in. 

"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get 
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian, Ford, 
Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer...?" 

"Hi there, Mr. Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to..." 

"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast." 

"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?" 

"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he 
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!" 

"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion 
rocket the bridge. 

When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he 
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest. 



Chapter 14 


Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness 
had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit 
of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they 
sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly 
engulfed them, seemingly for ever. 

After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying 
on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the 
Universe, and Everything. 

Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them. 
The cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still. It shone 
darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore. 

A green blur watched them disapprovingly. 

It coughed. 

"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a 
reservation?" 

Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his 
brain smart. Fie looked up woozily at the green blur. 

"Reservation?" he said weakly. 

"Yes, sir," said the green blur. 

"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?" 

In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows 
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did. 

"Afterlife, sir?" it said. 

Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one 
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. 

"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered. 

"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which way 
was up. Fie tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction 
from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to 
what he hoped were his feet. 



"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have 
survived that blast is there?" 

"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but 
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again. 

"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all." 

A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod 
Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he 
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it." 

"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We 
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet. 

"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks..." said the 
green blur, hovering impatiently beside them. 

"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into 
our component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of the 
slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing of your 
whole life flashing before you?" 

"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a lot of 
time out of my skulls you know." 

He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last 
becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless 
shapes. 

"So..." he said. 

"So what?" said Ford. 

"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead..." 

"Standing," Trillian corrected him. 

"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate..." 

"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could 
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing that 
surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. 

"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this 
desolate..." 

"Five star..." said Trillian. 

"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod. 

"Odd isn't it?" said Ford. 



"Er, yeah." 

"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian. 

They looked about themselves in bemusement. 

"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of apres 
vie." 

The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low 
vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal Universe, 
have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and 
even if it had been it wouldn't have been highlighted by concealed 
moodlighting. This is not, however, an ideal Universe, as was further 
evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and 
the way in which the fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped 
bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble- 
topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty 
thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the 
twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their 
insides in. 

A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar 
or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were 
deployed here and there about the bar area. A young VI'Hurg officer 
and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked 
glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main 
body of the Restaurant beyond. 

Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside 
the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under 
normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. 
These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that 
froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the 
top of his head was the sky. The sky was... 

An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place. 

"All in good time, sir," he said. 

Zaphod's eyes flashed. 

"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing 
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said 
and we missed it." 

Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he 
had just seen. 



He said, "I said it was a sort of apres..." 

"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?" 

"I said it was odd." 

"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was..." 

"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time 
resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark-suited green waiter, 
"perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks..." 

"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you don't 
stay alert." 

"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and gentlemen 
would care to order drinks before dinner..." 

"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green 
person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for 
the mere idea." 

"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be 
deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your pleasure." 

Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling. 

"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?" 

The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh. 

"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me." 

"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford. 

The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough. 

"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the 
time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest..." 

"Time journey?" said Zaphod. 

"Time journey?" said Ford. 

"Time journey?" said Trillian. 

"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur. 

The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost 
exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be 
slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter. 

"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir." 

"And we're not dead?" said Arthur. 

The waiter tightened his lips. 



"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would 
not attempt to serve sir." 

In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to 
describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of 
his arms and one of his thighs with the other. 

"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We finally got 
to where we were going. This is Milliways!" 

"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this 
is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 

"End of what?" said Arthur. 

"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and unnecessarily 
distinctly. 

"When did that end?" said Arthur. 

"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep breath. 
He didn't need to do this since his body was supplied with the 
peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small 
intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, 
when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath. 

"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I will then 
show you to your table." 

Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and 
bought most of it. 



Chapter 15 


The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most 
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been 
built on the fragmented remains of... it will be built on the 
fragmented... that is to say it will have been built by this time, and 
indeed has been - 

One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that 
of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no 
problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a 
broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also 
no problem about changing the course of history - the course of 
history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All 
the important changes have happened before the things they were 
supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. 

The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main 
work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time 
Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you for 
instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you 
in the past before you avoided it by time - jumping forward two days 
in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according 
to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own 
natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further 
past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting 
conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to 
another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother. 

Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified 
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and 
in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point 
have been left blank to save on printing costs. 

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of 
academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future 
Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. 



To resume: 

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most 
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. 

It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet 
which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected 
forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. 

This is, many would say, impossible. 

In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat 
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) 
the whole of creation explode around them. 

This is, many would say, equally impossible. 

You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like 
without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book 
retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time, (you 
can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta 
retrohome.) 

This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. 

At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con 
with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire 
population of space and time. 

This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. 

You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re- 
onvisiting... and so on-for further tense-corrections consult Dr. 
Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, 
because of the embarrassment this usually causes. 

This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, 
say the doubters. 

All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your 
own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of 
compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has 
been paid for. 

This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which 
is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon 
came up with this slogan: "If you've done six impossible things this 
morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the 
Restaurant at the End of the Universe?" 



Chapter 16 


At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His 
heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He 
was miserably happy. 

"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech, would 
you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have you 
been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it cleared up." 

Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into 
the obscurity of drink. 

"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man 
who rules the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe the 
man can't cook." 

His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded. 

"True," it said, "have another drink." 

Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has 
been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging-expensive 
and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided, he 
didn't really care too much. 

"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody." 

"You mean everything's under control." 

"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control. That 
would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what happened 
let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket. OK?" 

Ford shrugged. 

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the 
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top. 

A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric 
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to 
go away again. 

The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part of 
the bar. 



"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it gives 
me the creeps." 

"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself." 

"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive." 

"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?" 

"You call this life?" 

"You're beginning to sound like Marvin." 

"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make 
this violinist go away?" 

The waiter approached. 

"Your table is ready," he said. 

Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant resembles 
a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock. Each of its arms 
houses the bars, the kitchens, the forcefield generators which protect 
the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits, and the 
Time Turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and 
forwards across the crucial moment. 

In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete 
globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian 
now passed. 

At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and 
covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available 
because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells 
from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million 
unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver 
shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. 

"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo." 

"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people...! The things...!" 

"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people." 

"The people..." resumed Arthur, "the... other people..." 

"The lights...!" said Trillian. 

"The tables..." said Arthur. 

"The clothes...!" said Trillian. 

The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs. 

"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading 
his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of 



marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and at 
each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves a nd 
studying menus. 

"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a sense 
of occasion." 

The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage 
area where a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand 
tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst them were 
swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the 
paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where little expense has 
been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared. 
Arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone making an 
American Express commercial. 

Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. 

"Wowee," said Zaphod. 

"Zappo," said Ford. 

"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's 
works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told it to take us to the nearest 
place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe. Remind me to 
be nice to it one day." 

Fie paused. 

"Fley, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody." 

"Was?" said Arthur. 

"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," 
said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been done you know. FHi, guys," he 
called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms, "Flow did you 
do?" 

"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana. 

"I think so," replied the second iguana. 

"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana. 

"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana. 

"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back into 
silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the Universe. 

"Fley, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of 
the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. Fie pointed a swaying 
finger. 



"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See the 
man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?" 

Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made him 
feel dizzy. Finally he saw. 

"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Fley," 
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the 
biggest thing ever. Other than me." 

"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian. 

"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know? 
You never heard of Disaster Area?" 

"No," said Trillian, who hadn't. 

"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest..." 

"Richest..." suggested Zaphod. 

"... rock band in the history of..." he searched for the word. 

"... history itself," said Zaphod. 

"No," said Trillian. 

"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and 
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out." 

He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at 
the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone. 

Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. 

"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see 
you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very, very 
fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and was 
mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan Galactic 
Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on 
regardless. 

"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right? 

The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The Evildrome 
Boozarama, great days eh?" 

Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great 
days or not. Ford was not perturbed. 

"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors, 
you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks 
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the long 
nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Cafe 



Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in the next 
room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them. And 
you said you didn't care, and we said we did because we hated them 
so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over. 

"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued, 
wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system. And 
we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you had the 
option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!" 

He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. 

"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!" 

Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this 
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. 

"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into 
his wine glass. 

Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing 
Hotblack Desiato. 

"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a 
bottle for support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as it 
happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. 

"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm 
Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up 
with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!" 

Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat 
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. 

"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, 
you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible 
songs." 

His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on 
to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. 

"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his 
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and 
that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact 
that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the 
silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to see you after all 
this time," or in fact anything at all. More to the point he had not yet 
even moved. 


"Hotblack?" said Ford. 



A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and 
pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards 
to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The 
owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the 
order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact he was 
built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of 
solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's body had been stuffed 
looked as if it's only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it 
was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an 
orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to 
anything sweet ended. 

"Kid..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if it 
had been having a really rough time down in his chest. 

"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his 
feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't come 
further up the man's body. 

"Beat it," said the man. 

"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who 
are you?" 

The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being 
asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came up 
with an answer. 

"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you get it 
beaten for you." 

"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop 
spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now 
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and..." 

He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as 
an eyelash. 

"... and..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word 
to say after "and". 

The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". 

He said it. 

"And I am Mr. Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible 
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away 
before it gets damaged." 


"Now wait a minute," said Ford. 



"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr. Desiato 
speaks to no one!" 

"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter 
himself," said Ford. 

"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard. 

Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit 
to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side. 
There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen 
interest in Ford's welfare. 

"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?" 

The bodyguard told him. 



Chapter 17 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a 
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally 
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the 
loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the 
best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete 
bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians 
themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a 
heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet - or 
more frequently around a completely different planet. 

Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the 
familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, 
which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. 

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for 
artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public 
address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. 

This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back 
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research 
accountant has recently been appointed Professor of 
Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of 
both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, 
in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum 
is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. 

Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian 
were sitting waiting for the fun to begin. 

"Gotta have some food," said Ford. 

"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?" 

Ford waggled his head noncommittally. 

"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah." 

"What'd he say?" 



"Well, not a lot really. He's... er..." 

"Yeah?" 

"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit down." 

He sat down. 

The waiter approached. 

"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to 
meet the Dish of the Day?" 

"Huh?" said Ford. 

"Huh?" said Arthur. 

"Huh?" said Trillian. 

"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat." 

In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, 
thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in 
the face. 

It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him 
in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too sunken 
and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too 
long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently 
polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and 
thin too: they were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the 
curtain and gave the impression that if he didn't watch them like a 
hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something 
unspeakable in a corner. 

He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his 
features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled 
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's 
preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he 
leafed through a few sheets of jokes. 

A bell rang. 

He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands 
brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured 
sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone 
through the door. 



In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a 
single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that 
led up to the centre of the stage. 

Up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on 
to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its 
stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment 
bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause 
and displaying to them his bay window. He waved to his particular 
friends in the audience even though there weren't any there, and 
waited for the applause to die down. 

He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely 
from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere 
confines of his face. 

"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much. 
Thank you so much." 

He eyed them with a twinkling eye. 

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has 
now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand 
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, 
welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the 
Universe!" 

With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous 
applause. With another gesture he cut it. 

"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max 
Quordlepleen..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous 
throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it 
generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and 
wave.)"... and I've just come straight from the very very other end of 
time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar - 
where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and 
gentlemen - and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, 
the End of History itself!" 

Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed 
down further. On every table candles ignited themselves 
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and 
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million 
intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the 



darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very 
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. 

Max's voice was hushed as he continued. 

"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the 
band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into 
transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the 
ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous 
evening's apocalypse!" 

Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock 
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. 

A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, 

- a hideous light, 

-a boiling, pestilential light, 

- a light that would have disfigured hell. 

The Universe was coming to an end. 

For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently 
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. 

"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel," he said, "this is it." 

The band struck up again. 

"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with 
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very 
capable hands of Mr. Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big hand 
please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!" 

The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. 

Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so 
normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables, 
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. 

A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large 
fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small 
horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its 
lips. 

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I 
am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?" 
It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a 
more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. 



Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur 
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger 
from Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal, 
"Braised in a white wine sauce?" 

"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper. 

"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly, 
"nobody else's is mine to offer." 

Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the 
animal's shoulder appreciatively. 

"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been 
exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of good meat 
there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the 
cud. It swallowed the cud again. 

"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added. 

"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered 
Trillian to Ford. 

"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean 
anything." 

"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most revolting 
thing I've ever heard." 

"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his 
attention to the animal's enormous rump. 

"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting me 
to," said Arthur, "it's heartless." 

"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten," said 
Zaphod. 

"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it 
for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I don't care, 
I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er..." 

The Universe raged about him in its death throes. 

"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered. 

"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must 
be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself for 
months." 

"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically. 



"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at 
Arthur. 

"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have green 
salad?" 

"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are very 
clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut 
through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually 
wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. 
And here I am." 

It managed a very slight bow. 

"Glass of water please," said Arthur. 

"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a 
meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We haven't 
eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years." 

The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. 

"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just 
nip off and shoot myself." 

He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. 

"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane." 

It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen. 

A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge 
steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them without 
a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into 
hers. 

Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill. 

"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face 
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?" 

And the band played on. 

All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted. 
The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled 
scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an 
infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm 
was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch. Max 
returned to the stage with a flourish. 

"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having 
one last wonderful time?" 



"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when 
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time. 

"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as 
the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to 
tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle 
back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely 
exciting and terminal experience." 

He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. 

"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing 
penultimate about this one." 

He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after 
time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word night 
had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there was the 
endless repetition of the final moment, as the Restaurant rocked 
slowly forward over the brink of time's furthest edge - and back again. 
This "night" was good though, the audience was writhing in the palm 
of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. 

"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling 
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes 
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'." 

He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would not 
have dared clear its throat. 

"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness. Oblivion. 
Absolute nothing..." 

His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?" 

"Nothing... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine 
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!" 

The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he 
didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the audience 
like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He 
followed on. 

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about 
having a hangover in the morning - because there won't be any more 
mornings!" 

He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the 
sky, going through the same dead routine every night, but his glance 



was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one 
professional trusts another. 

"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of 
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here 
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties." 

He pulled a card from his pocket. 

"Do we have..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we 
have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club 
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?" 

A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. 
He peered around trying to find them. 

"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer. 

He got it, as he always did. 

"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads - and no cheating, 
remember this is a very solemn moment." 

He lapped up the laughter. 

"And do we also have, do we have... a party of minor deities from 
the Halls of Asgard?" 

Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across 
the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very 
pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. 

Hasbeens, he thought to himself. 

"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said. 

They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very 
thin lipped smile. 

"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives from 
Sirius B, are they here?" 

A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at 
each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped and 
barked unintelligibly. 

"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?" 

"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on 
his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a 
party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the 
Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon." 



There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of 
the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and 
staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the 
spotlight was turned on them. 

"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said he'd 
come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's hope he's 
hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes left!" 

The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted 
by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them. 

Max restrained his audience. 

"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence meant. 
No, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs, so I think a 
big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon..." 

The audience clapped respectfully. 

"... wherever he's got to!" 

He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre 
of the stage. 

He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. 

"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you here 
tonight - no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous. Because I 
know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I 
think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of 
everything, and then return home to your own eras... and raise 
families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for 
what you know to be right... it really gives one hope for the future of 
all lifekind. Except of course," he waved at the blitzing turmoil above 
and around them, "that we know it hasn't got one..." 

Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out 
in his mind. 

"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end... don't we 
go with it?" 

Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other 
words a rather unsteady one. 

"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this dive 
you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal warp 
thing. I think." 



"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup 
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak. 

"Look," said Ford, "HI show you." 

He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. 

"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal 
Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode in the 
matter curve..." 

It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to 
interrupt him. 

"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said. 

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon..." he found a small 
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon..." but found it rather 
tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork..." 

"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod. 

"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say... why don't 
we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe..." 

"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?" 

"Did I do that?" 

"Yes." 

"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean... I mean, look, do you 
know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick off?" 

"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on 
any of this. 

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A 
large round bath. And it's made of ebony." 

"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the 
Vogons." 

"Doesn't matter." 

"So you keep saying." 

"Listen." 

"Alright." 

"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's 
ebony. And it's conical." 

"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of..." 



"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it 
with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. 
Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when it's full, you pull the 
plug out... are you listening?" 

"I'm listening." 

"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you 
see, out of the plughole." 

"I see." 

"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit 
yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" 

"Tell me the clever bit." 

"I'll tell you the clever bit." 

Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit 
was. 

"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening." 

"Clever." 

"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now 
that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the 
film in the projector... backwards!" 

"Backwards?" 

"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, 
you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral 
upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?" 

"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur. 

"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax." 

Fie reached for his wine glass. 

"Where's my wine glass?" he said. 

"It's on the floor." 

"Ah." 

Tipping back his chair to look for it. Ford collided with the small 
green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable 
telephone. 

Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because 
he was extremely drunk. 



The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly 
understood. 

Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug 
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table. 

"Mr. Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter. 

"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak. 

"There is a phone call for you." 

"Hey, what?" 

"A phone call, sir." 

"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?" 

One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it 
was still shovelling in. 

"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and 
carried on. 

There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He 
shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not 
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's no 
one watching you have it? 

"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said Trillian. 
"Everyone saw you come in." 

"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod, 
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned." 

"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so fast 
people get hit by the shrapnel." 

"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod. 

"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously. 

"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the 
phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him, "I 
may need you." 

"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal 
gentlemen in question, sir..." 

"Metal?" 

"Yes, sir." 


"Did you say metal?" 



"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal 
gentleman in question..." 

"OK, carry on." 

"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a 
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat 
precipitately." 

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just 
arrived here." 

"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you 
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here." 

Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other. 

"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left 
here?" 

This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. 

"Precisely, sir," he said. 

"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod. 

"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again, 
"where exactly is here?" 

"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B." 

"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and came 
to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 

"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home 
stretch and running well, "the one was constructed on the ruins of the 
other." 

"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but 
not in space." 

"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree 
will you?" 

Arthur bristled. 

"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod. 

"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, 
sir." 

Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed 
coherent. 

"You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy-six 
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place," 



explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he 
had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable 
odds. 

"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send us to 
the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give or take five 
hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we never moved. 
Neat." 

They all agreed this was very neat. 

"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?" 

"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian. 

Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads. 

"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B." 

"When was this?" 

"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years ago I 
suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate Captain." 

The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in 
confusion. 

"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said. 

"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you 
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off." 

"Indeed, sir." 

"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you 
doing, kid?" 

There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. 

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. 

Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone. 

"It's Marvin," he said. 

"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a great 
time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe going foom. 
Where can we find you?" 

Again the pause. 

"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said 
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?" 



"'Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me, 

'open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that 
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am, brain the 
size of a planet and they ask me to..." 

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all. 

"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can 
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you 
like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one 
ready. Wait a minute." 

"Er, hey, Marvin..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad 
little clunks and gurgles came up the line. 

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. 

"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at 
us." 

"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, "I 
hope that gave satisfaction..." 

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you 
are?" 

"I'm in the car park," said Marvin. 

"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?" 

"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?" 

"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down." 

In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone 
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill. 

"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on 
down." 

"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur. 

"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum." 

"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big 
moment." 

"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." 

"A what?" 

"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy." 

Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved 
their way through the Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were riveted 
on the horror of the skies. 



"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is in 
the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very 
carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the 
ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?" 

There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at 
the back. 

"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry 
about whether you left the gas on now." 



Chapter 18 


The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless 
weaved his way through it. 

Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a 
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall. 

"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur. 

"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot. 

Lights flashed, gases swirled. 

"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we going?" 

"Down to the car park, come on." 

"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us 
straight back to the Heart of Gold." 

"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I don't 
want to play his games. Let's see what we can find." 

A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter 
took them down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant. 
They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make 
them happy as well as take them down. 

At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold 
stale air hit them. 

The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall 
with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty 
major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy 
throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt 
predominantly of impatience. 

They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk 
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim 
distance. 

It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship 
belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian 



mass production models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings 
of the very rich. 

Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have 
been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be clear on 
this point-avarice is definitely what it was. 

"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there." 

They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small 
metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a 
giant silver suncruiser. 

At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent 
tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk into 
one and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking 
back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the single most 
enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy. 

"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey, kid, 
are we pleased to see you." 

Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal 
face to look reproachfully, this is what it did. 

"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is." 

"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships. 

Ford went with him. 

Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. 

"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that he 
disliked intensely, "hanging around waiting for us all this time." 

"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand 
five hundred and seventy-nine years," said Marvin, "I counted them." 

"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, feeling - quite correctly in 
Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say. 

"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the 
second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third million 
years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline." 

He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say 
something, and then interrupted. 

"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down," he 
said and paused again. 

Trillian cleared her throat. 



"Is that..." 


"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago," 
continued Marvin. 

Again the pause. 

"Oh d..." 

"And that was with a coffee machine." 

He waited. 

"That’s a..." 

"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate 
tone. 

Trillian talked to Arthur instead. 


Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of 
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact. 

"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little 
star trolleys..." 

Zaphod looked and liked. 

The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but 
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to look 
at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet 
long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small 
horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-drive engine, which 
was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, 
however, was a heat-sink. 

The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and 
was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic 
field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this heat-sink 
enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow 
sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its 
surface. 

Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in 
existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most 
lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous 
- those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one 
of the Daedalus Club's Apres-Flare parties. 



Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on. 

"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the black 
sunbusters..." 

Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally misnamed one in 
fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was interstellar 
distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to 
something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed on. 

The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach built 
limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making 
the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail 
clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also 
rich enough not to take it seriously." It was wonderfully hideous. 

"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive, perspulex 
running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job." 

Fie examined every inch. 

"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the neutrino 
cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame." 

"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel 
Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and this thing just strolled 
past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just incredible." 

Zaphod whistled appreciatively. 

"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the third 
moon of Jaglan Beta." 

"Yeah, right?" 

"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, 
steers like a cow." 

Ford looked round the other side. 

"Fley, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted on 
this side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This must be 
Flotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song you know 
which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an 
amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt ships though." 

Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. FHis attention was 
riveted on the ship standing next to Flotblack Desiato's limo. FHis 
mouths hung open. 

"That," he said, "that... is really bad for the eyes..." 



Ford looked. He too stood astonished. 

It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, 
twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one 
remarkable thing about it. 

"It's so... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its 
shape... light just seems to fall into it!" 

Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. 

The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to 
tell how close you were standing to it. 

"Your eyes just slide off it..." said Ford in wonder. It was an 
emotional moment. He bit his lip. 

Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed - or 
more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand reached 
out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it 
again. His hand stopped again. 

"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice. 

Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. 

"You... you can't..." he said. 

"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be one 
mother of a mover..." 

He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads did - 
the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship. 

"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said. 

"You mean... er..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll 
off with it? You think we should?" 

"No." 

"Nor do I." 

"But we're going to, aren't we?" 

"How can we not?" 

They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself 
together. 

"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe 
will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down here 
to find their bourge-mobiles." 

"Zaphod," said Ford. 



"Yeah?" 

"How do we do it?" 

"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called. 

Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking 
noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to 
answer the summons. 

"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you." 

Marvin trudged towards them. 

"I won't enjoy it," he said. 

"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life 
stretching out ahead of you." 

"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin. 

"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's 
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things." 

"Sounds awful," Marvin said. 

"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you..." 

"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?" 

"What? Er... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He was 
keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short. 

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my 
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one." 

He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung 
open. 

Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening. 

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away 
again. 

Arthur and Trillian clustered round. 

"What's happening?" asked Arthur. 

"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship." 

"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod. 

"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black..." 


In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after 
which there wouldn't be any more moments. 



All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack 
Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, 
and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had 
closed out of respect. 

The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack 
Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good 
moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was 
not a man which improved with proximity. On account of his 
unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally 
inert. 

"Mr. Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, 
it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were 
clambering over each other to get out of the way. 

"Mr. Desiato? Can you hear me?" 

Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing. 

"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard. 

Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply. 
Supernaturally, however, he did. 

On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an 
inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. 

The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. 

"It's time we get going, Mr. Desiato," muttered the bodyguard, 
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want 
to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big 
audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred seventy-six 
thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking 
forward to it?" 

The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and 
dropped again. 

"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been great. 
You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr. Dan 
Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack. 

"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new 
one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there, I'll 
set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in the limo. OK?" 

The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine 
mysteriously emptied itself. 



The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the 
Restaurant. 

"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment 
you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air. Behind him, 
the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords. 
Max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in 
their contract that that's what they would do. His agent would have 
to sort it out. 

"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the 
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at 
an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!" 

The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and at that 
moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. 
Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them 
seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was 
swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was 
joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done this 
show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back 
in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly 
materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and 
wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden 
crown. 

"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?" 

At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the 
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt 
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying. 

Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. 

"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the 
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!" 

Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and 
handed his microphone to the Prophet. 

Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. 

The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone 
with confusion. 

"Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the 
most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment." 



He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his 
throat. 

"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min - " 
And so the Universe ended. 



Chapter 19 


One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel 
book, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative 
cheapness and the fact that it has the words DON'T PANIC written in 
large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally 
accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geo-social nature of 
the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine 
hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred 
and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in 
which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, 
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the 
back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few 
footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly 
tortuous Galactic Copyright laws. 

It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book 
backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully 
sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. 

Here is a sample: 

The Universe - some information to help you live in it. 

l~Area: Infinite. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the 
word "Infinite". 

Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much 
bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning 
size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, 
bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal 
multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to 
get across here. 



2~lmports: None. 


It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no 
outside to import things in from. 

3~Exports: None. 

See imports. 

4~Population: None. 


It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply 
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. 
However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must 
be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by 
infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average 
population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. 
From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also 
zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely 
the products of a deranged imagination. 

5~Monetary Units: None. 


In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, 
but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently collapsed, 
the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flaninian 
Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. 
Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since 
a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles 
across each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. 
Ningis are not negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to 
deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple 
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged 
imagination. 


6~Art: None. 



The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there 
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one. 

7~Sex: None. 

Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total 
lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all 
the non-existent people of the Universe occupied. 

However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now 
because it really is terribly complicated. For further information see 
Guide chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, 
nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the 
rest of the Guide. 



Chapter 20 


The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. 
Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that 
wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing - there was nothing in 
which a vacuum could be said to exist. 

The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, 
the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished 
along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were preparing 
to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for 
the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his small 
curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone. 

In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent. 

In to the car park came the late Mr. Hotblack Desiato, propelled 
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. 

They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship 
a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the 
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having 
seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system, 
moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote control 
system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to 
the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod Beeblebrox who had 
been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. 

The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and 
moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it 
accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and 
began the long journey back into the distant past. 

The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from 
the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this: 

The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass 
through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, 



Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and 
Where phases. 

For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question "How 
can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?" and the 
third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?" 

The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the 
End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated 
answer to that third question. 

What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take a 
large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, 
Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful 
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. 

"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent. 

"Badly," said Ford Prefect. 

"Where are we going?" said Trillian. 

"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent. 

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. 

"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent, ignoring 
this suggestion, "is that we're out of control." 

The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod 
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and 
whined like tired children in a supermarket. 

"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose 
love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the 
flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls 
that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light 
lights up black to let you know you've done it. What is this? Some kind 
of galactic hyperhearse?" 

The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was 
black, the seats - which were rudimentary since the only important 
trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned - were 
black, the control panel was black, the instruments were black, the 
little screws that held them in place were black, the thin tufted nylon 
floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it 
they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black. 



"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different 
wavelengths," offered Trillian. 

"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur. 

"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed." 

In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been chosen 
in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition. 

The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. 

"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick." 

"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through 
time." 

"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be ill." 

"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about 
this place." 

"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?" 
snapped Arthur. 

Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over to 
Arthur. 

"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do, right? 
The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?" 

"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about 
that." 

"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in the 
right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of yours." 

"Yes but..." 

"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our 
fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to ransom, 
and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint." 

Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. 

"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know? 
They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I 
supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, 
what's six times seven?" 

Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed 
with excitement. 

"Forty-two!" he cried. 

Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. 



"Yes," he said patiently," I know that." 

Zaphod's faces fell. 

"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all," said 
Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know." 

"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did 
the big firework." 

"We have a thing on Earth..." began Arthur. 

"Had," corrected Zaphod. 

"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know." 

A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. 

"I know," said Marvin. 

Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle 
with. 

"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk." 

"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued 
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing 
that." 

"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?" 

"Yes," said Marvin. 

Arthur stared in astonishment. 

"And...?" he said. 

"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse." 

"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 

"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up." 

"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of 
astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad 
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it." 

"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was 
still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, "if 
you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?" 

Marvin's head swivelled back to her. 

"You didn't ask," he said simply. 

"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round 
to look at him. 



At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, 
the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum. 

"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out 
the controls of this boat?" 

"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we just 
go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast." 

"Yeah, right," said Zaphod. 

"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to 
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off. 

"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while ship 
that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I think it is, and if 
it's saying what I think it's saying, then we've already gone too far 
back into the past. Maybe as much as two million years before our 
own time." 

Zaphod shrugged. 

"Time is bunk," he said. 

"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur. 

"Me," said Zaphod. 

"No. Who it really belongs to." 

"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right? 
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?" 

"Tell the ship that," said Arthur. 

Zaphod strode over to the console. 

"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner 
speaking to..." 

He got no further. Several things happened at once. 

The ship dropped out of time travel mode and re-emerged into real 
space. 

All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the 
time trip now lit up. 

A large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a 
wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them. 

None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that 
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the 
rear of the cabin, as were all the others. 



They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that 
thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen. 



Chapter 21 


Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast 
Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. 

That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage 
technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant 
control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the 
surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from 
there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have 
survived the tuning up. 

If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then 
his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the 
sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the 
neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, 
obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind 
them. 

Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay 
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the 
massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang drum 
complex. 

It was going to be a noisy show. 

Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle. Hotblack 
Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, 
and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high 
vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his 
psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard. 

A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, 
flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason 
with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a 
bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved 
conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The bass player was busy 
machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on 
board. 



Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a 
beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he 
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a 
small stone that would be his friend. 

The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the 
seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot 
and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right. 

The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage 
technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was 
being relayed to the interior of the black ship. 

Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and 
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers. 

"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel 
fifteen..." 

Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. 

"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice. 

A third voice cut in. 

"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking good. 
Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?" 

A computer voice answered. 

"On line," it said. 

"Take control of the black ship." 

"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby." 

"Testing channel twenty." 

Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the 
sub-ether receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit them. 

He stood there quivering. 

"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive mean?" 

"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the sun. 
Sun... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you 
steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?" 

"How do you know..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a 
Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's 
stuntship?" 

"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him." 

"The why... didn't... you... tell us!" 



"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild 
things." 

"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which 
followed. 

"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin. 

On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a 
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin. 

"... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm standing 
here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the middle of the 
Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses I can just 
about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all 
around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, 
and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn't know what's 
going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit 
it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, 
hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual 
things that environmentalists usually go on about. 

"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area 
met with the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them all shot, 
so nothing now lies in the way of..." 

Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford. 

"You know what I'm thinking?" he said. 

"I think so," said Ford. 

"Tell me what you think I'm thinking." 

"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship." 

"I think you're right," said Zaphod. 

"I think you're right," said Ford. 

"How?" said Arthur. 

"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking." 

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 

"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford. 

It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come 
up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for 
their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very 
obvious, as it 'It's a nice day," or "You're very tall," or "So this is it, 
we're going to die." 



His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising 
their lips, their mouths probably seized up. 

After a few months of observation he had come up with a second 
theory, which was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising their 
lips, their brains start working." 

In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcebron 
people of Kakrafoon. 

The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and 
insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most 
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the 
Galaxy. 

As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be 
offensively self righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal inflicted 
on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy. 

Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every 
slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile 
radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the 
weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and 
what a noisy place Kakrafoon had suddenly become. 

Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play 
host to a Disaster Area concert. 

The timing of the concert was critical. 

The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to 
hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of 
the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had 
time to travel out to Kakrafoon. 

The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time 
that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other 
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. 

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, 
its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment 
by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping 
and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel. Arthur and 
Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think 
that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare 
them out. 

Zaphod span round, wild-eyed. 



"Ford/ 1 he said, "how many escape capsules are there?" 

"None," said Ford. 

Zaphod gibbered. 

"Did you count them?" he yelled. 

"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on the 
radio?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch of 
people on board, and they said to say 'hi' to everybody." 

Ford goggled. 

"Didn't you tell them who we were?" 

"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something 
about a restaurant bill and my executors." 

Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control 
console. 

"Does none of this function?" he said savagely. 

"All overridden." 

"Smash the autopilot." 

"Find it first. Nothing connects." 

There was a moment's cold silence. 

Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. Fie stopped 
suddenly. 

"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?" 

Another moment passed. 

Slowly, the others turned to face him. 

"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I 
remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only 
bring it up because..." 

"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?" 

"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark control 
box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word 'emergency', above 
the word 'system' and beside the sign saying 'out of order'." 

In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to 
follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small 
black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the 
single small black button set into it. 



A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment 
which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new 
function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-finished wiring hung 
from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on 
the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the 
wall into which it should have been secured. 

A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this 
ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the works 
foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive 
teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make, 
and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was 
available at a ten percent discount and the accountant had explained 
that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the 
finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could 
buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to 
buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to 
enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the 
ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained 
that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant 
had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly 
from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had been 
concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which 
subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns." at 
five times the price. 

"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to 
sort through the tangle of wiring. 

After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin 
into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With 
a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished. 

"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no guidance 
system. A matter transference teleport without guidance 
programming could put you... well, anywhere." 

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen. 

"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go." 

"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go. 
Someone would have to stay and operate it." 

A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. 



"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?" 

"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin. 

A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an 
unexpected climax. 

The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on 
schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares 
licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few 
cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had been coasting 
close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. 

Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding 
desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected 
underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface 
to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of 
boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously 
vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion 
that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. 

Those-very few-who witnessed the event and survived swear that 
the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the 
air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. At 
that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered 
through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground. 

A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick 
with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was 
subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit 
less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the 
desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise. Even the telepathic 
power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was 
permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. 

A spokesman for Disaster Area - the one who had had all the 
environmentalists shot - was later quoted as saying that it had been 
"a good gig". 

Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few 
sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, 
and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast 
artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region 
of space. 




Chapter 22 


Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had, but 
never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was 
the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not 
as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. 

Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull 
stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The 
trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of 
them not being worth all the bother. On Earth - when there had been 
an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace 
bypass - the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved 
in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it 
had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover 
the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the 
sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more 
quickly from one place to another - particularly when the place you 
arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the 
place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short offish 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport 
which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms 
through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again 
just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had 
to be bad news. 

Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had 
even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that 
used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi-Werld III: 

Aldebaran's great, OK, 

Algol's pretty neat, 

Betelgeuse's pretty girls, 

Will knock you off your feet. 



They'll do anything you like, 

Real fast and then real slow, 

But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

Then I don't want to go. 

Singing, 

Take me apart, take me apart. 

What a way to roam. 

And if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

I'd rather stay at home. 

Sirius is paved with gold 
So I've heard it said 
By nuts who then go on to say 
"See Tau before you're dead." 

I'll gladly take the high road 
Or even take the low, 

But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

Then I, for one, won't go. 

Singing, 

Take me apart, take me apart. You must be off your head, 
And if you try to take me apart to get me there, 

I'll stay right here in bed. 

... and so on. Another favorite song was much shorter: 

I teleported home one night. 

With Ron and Sid and Meg, 

Ron stole Meggie's heart away, 

And I got Sidney's leg. 

Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was 
aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood up. 



"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect. 

Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was 
approaching looking red eyed and pasty. 

"Where are we?" gasped Arthur. 

Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor 
which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel wall - 
which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in 
schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued - 
curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner 
perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown 
hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. 

Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the 
outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see 
pinpoints of distant stars. 

"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said. 

Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. 

"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere. 
An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction. 
Judging by the way I feel I should think we've travelled a very long 
way indeed." 

"Flow do you feel?" 

"Bad." 

"Do you think they're..." 

"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and 
no way we can do anything about it. Do what I do." 

"What?" 

"Don't think about it." 

Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the 
wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. Fie took a deep breath. 

"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly. 

"Where?" 

"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!" 



Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from 
an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding 
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. 

"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved-in opposite 
directions. 

"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from." 

"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way." 

"They're not, they're..." 

They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. 
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite 
directions again. 

Fear gripped them. 

From both directions the noise was getting louder. 

A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the 
inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely 
long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it 
was getting colder and colder. Other corridors gave off it to the left 
and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of 
icy air as they passed. 

They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the 
corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet. 

They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened 
furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet 
was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but 
partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell 
him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an 
Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships, haunted hulks that 
roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested 
with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of 
incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of... - 
then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first 
corridor and pulled himself together. Flowever ghosts and demons 
may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he 
would lay any money you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. Fie 
grasped Arthur by the arm. 

"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to retrace 
their steps. 



A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest 
corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove 
into view directly in front of them. 

Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two 
dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits 
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon 
gibber. 

Ford Prefect stared after them. 

"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up 
and down the network of corridors. 

"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent. 

"Joggers," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. 

The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was 
very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, 
discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide. 

The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. 

And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things 
that hit their eyes were also coffins. 



Chapter 23 


The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, 
about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what 
appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. 

Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the 
floor of the vault. 

"Wild," he said. 

"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously 
stepping down after him. 

"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?" 

On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. 
They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared 
to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was - something 
that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi- 
translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features 
of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were 
humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was 
they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be 
discerned. 

Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, 
oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the 
place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his 
ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch. 

Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. Fie pulled a 
corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at 
something. 

"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur, "It's 
frosted over." 

He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. 
To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one 
too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford 
instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezeereed. 



"It says 'Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone 
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number." 

"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone sanitizer?" 

"Best kind." 

"But what's he doing here?" 

Ford peered through the top at the figure within. 

"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his 
which always made people think he'd been overdoing things recently 
and should try to get some rest. 

He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk 
towel work and he announced: 

"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!" 

The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of 
an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a 
second-hand car salesman, third class. 

An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's 
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the 
clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him. 

A thought occurred to Arthur. 

"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so cold?" 

"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the 
hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is 
anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand 
dead bodies through space?" 

"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through 
which the next chamber was dimly visible. 

Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked 
up again. 

"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there." 

"Fifteen million," said a voice. 

"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot." 

"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up. 
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits." 

"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and 
not making any other move. 

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?" 



Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had 
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His 
displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality 
of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long 
silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not 
been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told. 
"Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. 
Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things 
are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and 
prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for 
hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun 
for going out and making people miserable with." 

Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. 

The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round 
them. As he came into the light they could see his black and gold 
uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone 
with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash 
his lights in annoyance. 

He gestured at the door. 

"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power 
don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely 
followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the buttons. 

Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four 
oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past 
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. 

"Move!" screamed their captor. 

Arthur moved. 

Ford shrugged and moved. 

In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi 
along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty- 
four dreamless sleeps. 



Chapter 24 


"Er, captain..." 

"Yes, Number One?" 

"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two." 

"Oh, dear." 

High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into the 
infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he reclined 
beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them 
the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving - a 
panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the 
voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two-mile bulk 
of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them 
which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through 
the Galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had 
been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember 
at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something 
approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times 
the speed of something else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into 
the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this 
every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He 
didn't let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very 
insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing 
nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly 
fashion. 

He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was 
going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy 
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated 
about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough 
alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was still standing 
nearby. 

Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd 
spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer 



material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he 
was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took 
him. Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the 
place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still 
moving, Captain." "Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being 
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote. Ah yes, 
that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at 
Number One. 

"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having 
found some prisoners..." 

The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but 
he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way. 

"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's 
always wanted some." 

Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's 
apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them 
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or 
trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of 
continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large 
steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it. 

They entered. 

To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable 
thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter 
hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling 
display of stars shone down on them: to people who have eaten at 
the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are 
commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that 
crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this 
was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, 
and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his 
suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken them back at least 
a million, if not two million, years before their own time. 

No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. 

The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water 
crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the 
Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of 



plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried 
at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment 
would have made a gargoyle jump. 

As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly 
wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this 
that Number Two approached it. 

"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth - a difficult trick 
but he'd had years during which to perfect it. 

A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up 
above the rim of the monstrous bath. 

"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, 
"having a nice day?" 

Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already 
was. 

"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, 
sir!" he yapped. 

Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. 

"Er... hello," they said. 

The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found 
some prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a 
chap doing what he's best at. 

"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up, 
having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in the 
fridge Number one." 

"Certainly sir." 

It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much 
importance to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in 
the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a 
drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any 
one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. 

The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the 
Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary water server at slightly 
above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" 
which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common 
factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the 
same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds 
concerned made contact with any other worlds. 



What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as 
any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, 
and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young 
structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get 
deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they 
are very close to something of profound importance, and end up 
becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry 
with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and 
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too 
many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs. 

Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with 
frustration. 

"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed. 

The Captain peered at him in bemusement. 

"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked. 

"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came 
here!" 

"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in for 
a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?" 

"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!" 

The Captain looked at them doubtfully. 

"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to 
drink." 

A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced 
slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. 

"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin..." He jabbed Ford 
with the Kill-O-Zap gun. 

"Steady on. Number Two," admonished the Captain gently. 

"What do you want to drink?!!" NumberTwo screamed. 

"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What 
about you Arthur?" 

Arthur blinked. 

"What? Oh, er, yes," he said. 

"With ice or without?" bellowed NumberTwo. 

"Oh, with please," said Ford. 

"Lemon??!!" 



"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little biscuits? 
You know, the cheesy ones?" 

"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body 
quaking with apoplectic fury. 

"Er, Number Two..." said the Captain softly. 

"Sir?!" 

"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a 
relaxing bath." 

Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the 
Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably 
being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your 
glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening 
is an, as yet, unresolved problem. 

He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard 
line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting 
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were 
suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you 
would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line 
rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs. 

"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that 
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final shot 
delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to 
practise darting eye movements in the mirror. 

The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame 
smile. 

"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said. 

Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur 
lowered his. 

Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath 
pedestal. He patted it. 

"Nice," he lied. 

He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he 
grinned. It was safe. 

"Er..." he said to the Captain. 

"Yes?" said the Captain. 



"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is in 
fact?" 

A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round. 

It was the first officer. 

"Your drinks," he said. 

"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx. 
Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a 
whisky and soda. 

"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip, "the 
bodies. In the hold." 

"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise. 

Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for 
granted, he thought. Could it be that the Captain doesn't know he's 
got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? 

The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be 
playing with a rubber duck. 

Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, 
but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move. The 
first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling 
benignly. 

"Bodies?" said the Captain again. 

Ford licked his lips. 

"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account 
executives, you know, down in the hold." 

The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and 
laughed. 

"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen. 
They're going to be revived." 

Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked. 

Arthur seemed to come out of a trance. 

"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he said. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV 
producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, 
public relations executives, management consultants, you name them. 
We're going to colonize another planet." 

Ford wobbled very slightly. 



"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain. 

"What, with that lot?" said Arthur. 

"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just 
one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the 'B' Ark you see. Sorry, 
could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?" 

Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around 
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure. 

"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more 
drinks of course." 

Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer's 
tray and refilled his glass to the top. 

"What," he said, "is a 'B'Ark?" 

"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around 
joyfully with the duck. 

"Yes," said Ford, "but..." 

"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet, 
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed." 

"Doomed?" 

"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole 
population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another 
planet." 

Flaving told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied 
grunt. 

"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur. 

"What did you say dear fellow?" 

"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on." 

"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, 
you see, three Arks in Space, and... I'm not boring you am I?" 

"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating." 

"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have someone 
else to talk to for a change." 

Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and 
then settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted 
from their favourite prey of months old meat. 

"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain, "is 
that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly 



boring because half the time you know what you're going to say 
next." 

"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise. 

The Captain thought for a moment. 

"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?" He fished 
around and found it. 

"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first ship, 
the 'A' ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great 
artists, you know, all the achievers; and into the third, or 'C' ship, 
would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things 
and did things, and then into the 'B' ship - that's us - would go 
everyone else, the middlemen you see." 

He smiled happily at them. 

"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little 
bathing tune. 

The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one 
of his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was 
currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards behind 
them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward 
moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously 
avoided each other's eyes. 

"Er..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that was 
wrong with your planet then?" 

"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it was 
going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was that the 
moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely 
terrifying prospect whatever it was." 

"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the 
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot 
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?" 

Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that 
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in. 

"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer 
told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten 
by an enormous mutant star goat!" 

"Oh really..." said Ford Prefect. 



"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth 
ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that 
could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned 
like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as 
you have never... never... ever..." 

"And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?" inquired 
Arthur. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I 
thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would 
be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut 
and where the phones were clean." 

"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important. 

And the other ships, er... they followed on after you did they?" 

For a moment the Captain did not answer. Fie twisted round in his 
bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the 
bright galactic centre. Fie squinted into the inconceivable distance. 

"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed 
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough we 
haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago... but 
they must be behind us somewhere." 

Fie peered off into the distance again. 

Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown. 

"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat..." 

"Ah yes..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his 
voice, "the goat..." Flis eyes passed over the solid shapes of the 
instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away 
innocently at him. Fie stared out at the stars, but none of them said a 
word. Fie glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost 
in their own thoughts for a moment. Fie glanced at Ford Prefect who 
raised his eyebrows at him. 

"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now 
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else... I mean does it 
strike you as odd Number Two?" 

"Errrrrrrrrrrr..." said Number Two. 

"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things you're 
going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of 
drop us off at the nearest convenient planet..." 



"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain, "because 
our trajectory thingy was preset before we left Golgafrincham, I think 
partly because I'm not very good with figures..." 

"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford 
suddenly losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you 
meant to be reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?" 

"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second now. 
It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact. Oh, I don't 
know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?" 

"So we're actually going to land in a minute?" 

"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no... er..." 

"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply. 

"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words 
carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we were programmed to 
crash on it." 

"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur. 

"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I think. 

There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember 
at the moment. It was something to with... er..." 

Ford exploded. 

"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted. 

"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason." 



Chapter 25 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the 
planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and mysterious 
history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green with the blood of 
those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched 
and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of 
the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and 
nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows 
and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the 
lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who 
have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a 
land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of 
the spirit. This was its history. 

And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious 
figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of 
Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes 
where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, 
circle round them, and throw rocks at them. 

And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away 
and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with 
all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then 
break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great Song 
Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and 
even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same 
pattern. 

The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth 
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses. 
The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in 
distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea 
with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening 
princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved 
enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. 



The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of 
all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk 
back. 

All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a 
descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the 
spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of 
Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their 
population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, 
rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a 
virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone. 



Chapter 26 


That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant little 
green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the 
uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western spiral 
arm of the Galaxy. 

In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously 
but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained 
flight path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had 
been programmed to convey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to 
its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process. 

Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had 
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its 
final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a 
few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep- 
frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at 
once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or 
twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as 
burning meteors - the detritus of its descent - flashed across the sky. 

In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and 
sank for ever into the stinking depths. 

When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light 
over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations 
executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way 
desperately to dry land. 

A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back 
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and 
after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some 
restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. 

Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in 
the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but 
those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the 
day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each 



looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and 
recover from their nightmare ordeal. 

Two figures moved further afield. 

From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the 
horror of which they could not feel a part. 

"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur. 

Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. 

"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said. 

"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and 
harmony?" said Arthur. 

Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. 

"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work. 

Never mind." 

Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to 
indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to 
assume that this had in fact happened. 

"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a while. 

"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even 
survival. Strange but true." 

A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the 
landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below them. 

"I think they'll manage for a while," he said. 

Arthur looked up sharply. 

"Why do you say that?" he said. 

Ford shrugged. 

"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further 
questions. 

"Look," he said suddenly. 

Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling 
masses a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more 
accurate description. Fie appeared to be carrying something on his 
shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he 
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken 
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. 

Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. 



"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement." 

"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment, 
"but I'm off." 

Fie sat a while in silence. 

After a while this seemed to require comment. 

"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said 
Arthur. 

"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence." 

Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with 
knobs on a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a Sub- 
Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not 
pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided into two 
parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been 
demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that 
this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to 
that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the "everything else" 
category. 

"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing. 

Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the 
primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth 
sausage. 

"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are no 
transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip? Are 
you listening to me?" 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"We're in trouble," said Ford. 

"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him. 

"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our 
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak 
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field - in which case we 
just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. 
Coming?" 

He picked up his gear and strode off. 



Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had 
struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues 
collapsing. 

Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford. 



Chapter 27 


"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and 
Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship Heart of 
Gold and lay panting on the floor. 

Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. 

"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a 
chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it. 

"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability 
Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will arrive 
there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and prepare 
yourself for the meeting?" 

Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small 
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took a long 
pull at it. 

"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done, alright? 
I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on beaches and 
stuff?" 

"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop. 

"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her 
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?" 

"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the 
man who rules the Universe." 

"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, 
"a social climber." 



Chapter 28 


The major problem - one of the major problems, for there are 
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is 
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get 
people to let them do it to them. 

To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most 
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To 
summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting 
themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do 
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a 
problem. 

And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic 
Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power 
that they very rarely notice that they're not. 

And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who? 

Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed 
to? 



Chapter 29 


On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in 
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is 
protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this 
galaxy have a key - it was raining. 

It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of 
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a 
stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath. 

The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small 
shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land. It 
obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to 
the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells 
which had been placed there. 

The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, 
but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was 
otherwise engaged. 

He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that 
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back 
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. 

In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched table, 
an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm. 

There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was 
currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his shambling 
form over it. 

"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo... pussy 
want his fish? Nice piece of fish... pussy want it?" 

The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather 
condescendingly at the piece offish the man was holding out, and 
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. 

"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think," said 
the man. Doubt crept into his voice. 

"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I tell?" 



He proffered the fish again. 

"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I 
don't get involved." He sighed. 

"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to 
judge?" 

He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. 

"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat 
exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and 
pounced on to the fish. 

"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because in my 
mind you will waste away if you don't." 

He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a 
pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and 
experimented with the different ways of bringing them together. He 
tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then 
next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he 
tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then 
he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It 
made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was 
every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This 
had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of 
clues before losing interest. 

He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of 
the bones of his hip. 

"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I imagine 
I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in 
their six black ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see 
pussy?" 

He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the 
fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. 

"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do 
their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing songs 
to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. 

"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just think 
they're asking me questions." 

He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see 
what it was like. 



"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on the 
floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a 
memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence I know, but 
then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they've left 
me." 

He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it. 

"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator." 

He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to 
sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the 
calculator aside. 

"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he said, 
"To come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of 
singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems 
to me. Who can tell, who can tell." 

From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from 
the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. 

"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last. "A big 
white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six black ones. 

And the six green ones. And the others who say they come from so far 
away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small black ones can look 
like one big white one at certain times. Perhaps I would like a glass of 
whisky. Yes, that seems more likely." 

He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the 
mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat again. 

"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said. 

A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart 
of Gold. 

Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into 
themselves to keep the rain off their faces. 

"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain. 

"Yes," said Zarniwoop. 

"That shack?" 

"Yes." 


"Weird," said Zaphod. 



"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have 
come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a shack." 

They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through, at 
the door. They knocked. They shivered. 

The door opened. 

"Hello?" said the man. 

"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe..." 

"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod. 

The man smiled at him. 

"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?" 

Zaphod looked at him in astonishment. 

"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?" 

"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel about 
it might be an altogether different matter. If you feel warmth makes 
you dry, you'd better come in." 

They went in. 

They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight distaste, 
Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight. 

"Hey, er..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?" 

The man looked at them doubtfully. 

"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very 
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name." 

He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair, 
Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod lay on the 
mattress. 

"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat. 

"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions." 

"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you like." 

"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod. 

"You'd better ask him," said the man. 

"Does he talk?" said Zaphod. 

"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very 
unreliable." 

Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket. 

"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?" 



"How can I tell?" said the man. 

Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. 

"How long have you been doing this?" 

"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?" 

Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what 
he had been expecting. 

"Yes," he said. 

"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed 
to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical 
sensations and my state of mind?" 

Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden 
clothes. 

"So you answer all questions like this?" he said. 

The man answered quickly. 

"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say 
things. More I cannot say." 

Zaphod laughed happily. 

"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx spirit. 

He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the Universe, who 
took it with pleasure. 

"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is." 

"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they? 

In ships..." 

"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian. 

"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them? 
About people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, 
about everything going on out there in the Universe?" 

"Out there?" said the man, "out where?" 

"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door. 

"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man politely, 
"the door's closed." 

The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. 

"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried 
Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they don't 
exist!" 



The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst Zarniwoop 
quivered with anger. 

"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't trust the 
thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is one - for 
granted." 

Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. 

"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My 
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay." 

"But don't you believe in anything?" 

The man shrugged and picked up his cat. 

"I don't understand what you mean," he said. 

"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours 
affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all monstrously 
wrong!" 

"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And 
neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear. It is 
folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they 
know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes 
and ears." 

Trillian said: 

"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment." 

She left and walked into the rain. 

"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop. 

"I have no opinion. How can I say?" 

"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped out. 

Outside, he said to her: 

"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?" 

"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain. 

Inside, Zarniwoop continued. 

"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?" 

The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he 
heard the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to cover 
it. 

"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with 
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man." 



"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say 'The Lord'. You believe in 
something!" 

"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, "I call 
him The Lord. I am kind to him." 

"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you 
know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys 
what he thinks of as your kindness?" 

"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely 
pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do 
you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired." 

Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. 

"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly. 

"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back into 
his chair and refilling his whisky glass. 

"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!" 

"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for..." 

"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There was 
no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no sign to 
show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain. He turned 
and ran back to the shack and found it locked. 

The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he 
played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when 
he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various 
noises continued outside, but he didn't know whether they were real 
or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would 
react. 



Chapter 30 


The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. 
Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of 
judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the 
air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic totally silent. 

A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which 
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of 
insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits. 
Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on 
a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful 
he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green 
hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and 
tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had 
kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O- 
Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and 
less annoyance at its continued silence. Fie was beginning to think he 
liked it here. 

Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably 
in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling 
refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his 
satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those before moving on. 

So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck 
out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this 
world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from 
and where they were going. 

Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world 
they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face 
amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they 
both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a 
humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Flalf an 
hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after 
that another. 



A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped 
short. 

Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about 
two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford 
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children 
and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made 
of mud and branches. 

Ford and Arthur held their breath. 

The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they all 
stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and 
clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. 

Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards 
them. Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. 

For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side 
making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and 
whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not 
issuing any invitations. 

For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen. 

After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. 

"Flello," he said. 

The women drew their children slightly closer to them. 

The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole 
disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it was 
not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome. 

One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest 
of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, 
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. 

"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly. 

This caught Arthur by surprise. Fie had grown so used to receiving 
an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard 
via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of 
it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it 
didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered 
at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm 
grasp on. Fie guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had 
as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and 



that the Babel Fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at 
Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. 

"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking us if 
we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village." 

A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to 
confirm this. 

"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug," 
continued the man-creature. 

"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that we 
are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we 
would walk round his village rather than through it would make them 
all very happy." 

"So what do we do?" 

"I think we make them happy," said Ford. 

Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the 
clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who 
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business. 

Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few 
hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile 
of fruit lying in their path - berries that looked remarkably like 
raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that 
looked remarkably like pears. 

So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, 
though the trees and bushed were laden with them. 

"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries on 
strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the 
point at which to start toying with them is when you're going to die if 
you don't. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch-hiking 
is to eat junk food." 

They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It 
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. 

"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er..." 

"Yes?" said Arthur. 

"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to 
eat it," said Ford. 



The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which 
looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries and 
strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, 
even in ice cream commercials. 

"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said. 

"Maybe that's what they want us to do." 

"Alright, look at it this way..." 

"Sounds good so far." 

"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either they want 
to feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we don't eat it they'll 
just attack us some other way. If we don't eat, we lose out either 
way." 

"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one." 

Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like 
pears. 

"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said Ford. 

"Eh?" 

"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?" 

"Yes of course I do." 

"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and 
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise 
surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 
'Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten 
it." 

"Why not?" 

"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of 
mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under 
them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in 
the end." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Never mind, eat the fruit." 

"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden." 

"Eat the fruit." 

"Sounds quite like it too." 

Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. 



"It's a pear," he said. 

A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect 
turned round and called out. 

"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind." 

They went on their way. 

For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on 
finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they 
once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-creature amongst 
the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they 
rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were 
grateful simply to be left alone. 

The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was 
where the sea started. 

Flaving no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed 
the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles wide and they 
had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at 
least as beautiful as the one they had left. 

Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they 
were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by 
deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too 
great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they 
were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles 
behind them. 

Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic 
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so 
faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more 
than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. 

On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they 
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was 
harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a 
streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing difficulty of the 
journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise 
lacking. Fie strode onwards relentlessly. 

Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous 
terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow 



covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their 
bones. 

They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford 
Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex- 
Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian. 

The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, 
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a 
form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational - and 
extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have 
finished their devotional training and just before they take their final 
vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. 

Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a 
while and smiling. 

After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from out 
of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile 
at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a 
deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of 
creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding 
countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured 
man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was 
almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it 
and break its neck. 

"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how 
to generate the right smell." 



Chapter 31 


A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a 
coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to 
the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic 
ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice-fjords. 

For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks 
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty. 

"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly. 

It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high 
rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy 
promontories. 

"Arthur!" yelled Ford again. 

Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried faintly 
in the wind. 

Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there 
crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. Fie was tense with excitement 
- his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's. 

"Look," he said, "look!" 

Arthur looked. Fie saw the solid wall of blue ice. 

"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it." 

"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it. Look!" 

Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. 

Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows. 

"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again." 

Arthur moved back and looked again. 

"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking 
for?" 

And suddenly he saw it. 

"You see it?" 


Fie saw it. 



His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got 
anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to 
contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking 
at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly 
fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control 
of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. 

For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without 
letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what 
was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur 
dropped restfully to the ground. 

The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network 
of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. 
Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of 
letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for 
those, like Arthur, who couldn't read Magrathean there was above 
the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. 

It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. 

It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the 
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on. 



Chapter 32 


A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees 
upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise 
danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it 
generally offended. 

The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an 
indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he 
had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness 
in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life 
remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock 
which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask 
daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm 
water, it must be said, as they hadn't yet worked out a way of heating 
it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties 
were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, 
preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - 
perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't 
found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps 
that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility 
had been reluctantly acknowledged. 

No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that 
when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, 
and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across 
the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five 
hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still. It was very 
important to have things to look forward to. 

Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, 
increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought 
that any moment now they might stop. That was something he 
looked forward to as well. 

What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things: 
the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the 
peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of 



hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and 
his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined 
up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a 
phone that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones 
that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all). 

Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people 
slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon 
committee meeting. 

The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The 
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite. 

Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the 
edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from 
foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, 
his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his beard was as thick 
and his face as bronzed as a country-rock singer's. 

He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for 
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit. 

The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged 
around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a 
fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even 
torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to 
see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and 
wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the 
coming winter. Ford's eyes narrowed. They couldn't be interested in 
botany of a sudden could they? 

In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose above 
the hubbub. 

"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order 
if that's at all possible. Is that alright with everybody?" He smiled 
genially. "In a minute. When you're all ready." 

The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except 
for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable 
musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity 
threw some leaves to him. If there was any reason for this then it 
escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. 



A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one 
of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing up, 
clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify 
to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. 

The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him. 

A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right 
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak. 

Ford dropped down out of the tree. 

"Hi there," he said. 

The crowd swivelled round. 

"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on 
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?" 

"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd 
prepared. He decided he'd better be a little stronger on the subject. 

"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you 
news..." 

"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had a 
hot bath in weeks." 

Ford refused to be headed off. 

"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest 
you." 

"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had 
interrupted. 

Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile. 

"Now, come on," he said. 

"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a 
management consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on the 
importance of observing the committee structure." 

Ford looked round the crowd. 

"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet." 

"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant. 

"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock." 

The management consultant decided that testiness was what the 
situation now called for. 

"Well, call it a chair," he said testily. 



"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford. 

"You obviously have no conception," said the management 
consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned 
hauteur, "of modern business methods." 

"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford. 

A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. 

"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion." 

"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser. 

"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant. 

"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." Fie plonked 
himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his 
temper. 

The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise. 

"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five hundred 
and seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of 
Fintlewoodlewix..." 

Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. 

"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three 
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!" 

"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to 
examine the agenda sheet..." 

"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily. 

"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford. 

"... you... will... see..." continued the girl firmly, "that we are having 
a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development Sub-Committee 
today." 

"Oh... ah - " said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is 
recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next Tuesday 
do?" 

"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What 
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?" 

"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was a 
couple of sticks..." 

"So what have you done with them?" 

Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed 
over the fruits of his labour to Ford. 



Ford held them up for all to see. 

"Curling tongs," he said. 

The crowd applauded. 

"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day." 

The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but 
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded. 

"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the girl, 
"When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll know that 
before any new product can be developed it has to be properly 
researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how 
they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them." 

The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful 
from Ford. 

"Stick it up your nose," he said. 

"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the 
girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?" 

"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd. 

"Yes!" shouted some. 

"No!" shouted others happily. 

They didn't know, they just thought it was great. 

"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? 
It sounds a terribly interesting project." 

"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty 
there." 

"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean, 
difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!" 

The marketing girl soured him with a look. 

"Alright, Mr. Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us what 
colour it should have." 

The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. 

Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again. 

"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?" 

As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise 
from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't believe the 
amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in 
marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of 



their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them 
still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they 
struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy, and 
utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and 
banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. 

"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for he was their leader - 
"Permission to report sir!" 

"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot 
springs?" said the Captain despondently. 

"No sir!" 

"Thought you wouldn't." 

Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before 
the bath. 

"We have discovered another continent!" 

"When was this?" 

"It lies across the sea..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes 
significantly, "to the east!" 

"Ah." 

Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his 
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd. 

"We have declared war on it!" 

Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing - 
this was beyond all expectation. 

"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!" 

He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, 
or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: 
the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously 
composing a national anthem. 

"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant." 

Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly 
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged 
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two. 

"War?" he said. 

"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. 

"On the next continent?" 



"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!" 

"But there's no one even living there yet!" 

Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point. 

Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes 
were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three inches 
from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats 
or rolled newspapers. 

"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have left 
an open-ended ultimatum." 

"What?" 

"And blown up a few military installations." 

The Captain leaned forward out of his bath. 

"Military installations Number Two?" he said. 

For a moment the eyes wavered. 

"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright... trees." 

The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like whips 
over his audience. 

"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!" 

He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched 
off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the 
ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught 
up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing. 

Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. 

"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations 
had died down. 

"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl. 

"Oh yes?" said Ford. 

"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating 
documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area." 

"They're not cavemen." 

"They look like cavemen." 

"Do they live in caves?" 

"Well..." 


"They live in huts." 



"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a wag 
from the crowd. 

Ford rounded on him angrily. 

"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying 
out?" 

On their journey back. Ford and Arthur had come across two 
derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where 
they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were stricken and 
listless, as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than 
the body. They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness. Their 
future had been taken away from them. 

"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?" 

"Er... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out the wag 
again. 

Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd. 

"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since we've 
arrived that they've started dying out!" 

"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the 
marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant twist which is the 
hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very 
committed." 

"Fie should be," muttered Ford. 

"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was 
beginning to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next, 
Captain." 

"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully nice." 

"Fle's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of 
responsibility, the loneliness of command..." 

The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. 

"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said finally, 
"one's never alone with a rubber duck." 

Fie held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the 
crowd. 

All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in stony 
silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was 
waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary. 



At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he 
would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened. 

He rose to his feet. 

"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the 
subject of fiscal policy..." 

"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!" 

The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish 
could have copied. 

"Fiscal policy..." he repeated, "that is what I said." 

"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you 
actually produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know." 

"If you would allow me to continue..." 

Ford nodded dejectedly. 

"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as 
legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich." 

Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring 
appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with 
which their track suits were stuffed. 

"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run 
into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf 
availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has 
something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut." 

Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management 
Consultant waved them down. 

"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and 
effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive 
defoliation campaign, and... er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll 
all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances." 

The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two 
until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of 
the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight 
and gave the Management Consultant a standing ovation. The 
accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable Autumn. 

"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect. 

"You're absolutely barmy," he suggested. 

"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined. 



The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started 
out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view, 
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main 
directed at them they wearied of it. 

Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. 

"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've 
been doing all these months then? You and that other interloper have 
been missing since the day we arrived." 

"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find out 
something about this planet." 

"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to me." 

"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered 
this planet's future." 

Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have any. 
They didn't know what he was talking about. 

He continued. 

"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all 
choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it won't 
make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already happened. 
Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end of that time your 
race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you. Remember that, 
two million years!" 

The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they 
had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of 
gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he 
would go away. 

They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the 
clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was 
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees. 

Fie turned back once. 

"Two million years!" he said and laughed. 

"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a few 
more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped it 
over the side." 



Chapter 33 


A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily 
engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. 

What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a 
wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large 
square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, 
thirteen to a side. 

Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish 
stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting 
morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native 
men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept 
embodied in these stones. 

So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of 
them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally 
encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he 
had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd managed to get 
the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of 
these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in 
their actual intelligence. 

In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters 
on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add 
some more themselves. 

It was not going well. 

Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. 

"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some 
of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q scores ten you 
see, and it's on a triple word score, so... look. I've explained the rules 
to you... no no, look please, put down that jawbone... alright, we'll 
start again. And try to concentrate this time." 

Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his 
head. 

"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly. 



Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all 
this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like 
a dream on him when he was a child. But things were different then, 
or rather would be. 

"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said. 

"They're not cavemen," said Ford. 

"They look like cavemen." 

Ford let it pass. 

"I see," he said. 

"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know is 
grunt and they can't spell it." 

He sighed and sat back. 

"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford. 

"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur 
burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger 
might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of 
foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He 
jumped to his feet. 

"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from 
those... cretins we arrived with?" he said. 

"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to 
imagine. We've seen it." 

"But..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. 

"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape." 

Arthur kicked at a stone. 

"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked. 

"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating. 

"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the glacier. Did 
you tell them?" 

"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?" 

"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it 
means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's where 
I was born!" 

"Was?" said Ford. 

"Alright, will be." 



"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that? Go 
and say to them, 'Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that in two 
million years' time I will be born just a few miles from here.' See what 
they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set fire to it." 

Arthur absorbed this unhappily. 

"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not 
these poor creatures here." 

Fie went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging 
listlessly with the stone letters. Fie shook his head. 

"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the human 
race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race. The human 
race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill 
making documentaries about themselves." 

Arthur winced. 

"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of 
desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on the 
Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary 
catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. 

"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change 
the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth. Like it 
or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. 
In two million years they get destroyed by the Vogons. FHistory is 
never altered you see, it just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old 
thing, life, isn't it?" 

Fie picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush 
where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn't 
stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its 
bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed 
it away. 

During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and 
struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer 
on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly 
passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been 
polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral it is possible to 
draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a 
pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. 



Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was 
completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. They were 
looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters 
around. 

"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur. 

"They're not..." 

"What?" 

"Oh never mind." 

The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged 
on the rock. 

"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said Arthur. 

"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock 
again. 

"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers." 

"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on the 
rock. 

"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur. 

"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said 
Ford, "he's pointing at the letters." 

"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on 
telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc." 

The native banged on the rock again. 

They looked over his shoulder. 

Their eyes popped. 

There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid 
out in a clear straight line. 

They spelt two words. 

The words were these: 

"Forty-Two." 

"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters 
angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his 
colleague. 

Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. 

"Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each other. 

"Yes," they both said. 



"Forty-two," said Arthur. 

"Forty-two," said Ford. 

Arthur ran over to the two natives. 

"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed 
to mean?" 

One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, 
rolled over again and went to sleep. 

The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford 
Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said it. 

"You know what this means," said Ford. 

"Not entirely." 

"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate 
Answer." 

"Yes." 

And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to 
calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer." 

"So we are led to believe." 

"And organic life was part of the computer matrix." 

"If you say so." 

"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an 
integral part of the computer program, and that we and the 
Golgafrinchans are not." 

"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are 
obviously set to replace them." 

"Exactly. So do you see what this means?" 

"What?" 

"Cock up," said Ford Prefect. 

Arthur looked around him. 

"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said. 

Ford puzzled for a moment. 

"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last, 

"because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your brain 
wave patterns." 

"But..." 



"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might 
give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how we can 
though." 

They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started 
pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation he 
could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could believe in, the 
trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to 
nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. 

Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He 
sighed and put it away. 

Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made 
Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The letter he 
put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple 
of letters next to them They were an S and an H as it happened. By a 
curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way 
Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a 
moment. He hadn't done it deliberately, it was just a random chance. 
His brain got slowly into first gear. 

"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in my 
brain wave patterns but I'm not consciously aware of it it must be 
somewhere in my unconscious." 

"Yes, I suppose so." 

"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern 
forward." 

"Oh yes?" 

"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by 
that pattern." 

"Like how?" 

"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded." 

Ford leapt to his feet. 

"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with 
a few deft knots transformed it into a bag. 

"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because it's 
brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on." 

The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad 
raindrops fell. 



They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them 
into the bag. They shook them up. 

"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come 
on, come on." 

Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of 
stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to 
Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them. 

"W," said Ford, "H, A, T... What!" 

He blinked. 

"I think it's working!" he said. 

Arthur pushed three more at him. 

"D, O, Y... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford. 

"Here's the next three." 

"O, U, G... Doyoug... It's not making sense I'm afraid." 

Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. 

"E, T, doyouget... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working! This is 
amazing, it really is working!" 

"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he 
could go. 

"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U,... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y,... What do you get if 
you multiply,... S, I, X,... six, B, Y, by, six by... what do you get if you 
multiply six by... N, I, N, E,... six by nine..." He paused. "Come on, 
where's the next one?" 

"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were." 

He sat back, nonplussed. 

He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no 
more letters. 

"You mean that's it?" said Ford. 

"That's it." 

"Six by nine. Forty-two." 

"That's it. That's all there is." 



Chapter 34 


The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A 
warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the 
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect 
droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late 
afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a 
moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford 
Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but 
in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. 

"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with 
you in a moment." 

"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller and 
slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior 
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much. 

Ford pulled himself together. 

"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just 
contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise." 

"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of 
yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but you 
did bang on a bit." 

"Did I? Oh yes." 

"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter round- 
faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising 
company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of this world 
were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact 
that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn't be a 
hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of 
toothpaste. 

"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect 
happily. "Come and join us. I'm Ford, this is Arthur. We were just 
about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait." 

The girls looked at them doubtfully. 



"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella." 

"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford. 

"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur. 

"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as 
Ford." 

"Good." 

There was a slight pause. 

"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million 
years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying." 

"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter." 

"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a 
hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's two million 
years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do." 

"Vogons?" said Mella. 

"Yes, you wouldn't know them." 

"Where'd you get this idea from?" 

"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past, or the 
future." Arthur smiled and looked away. 

"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked 
Agda. 

"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, 
it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green of the hills, the river 
down in the valley, the burning trees." 

"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said Mella, 
"destroying a world just to make a bypass." 

"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off in the 
seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic 
bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion 
people." 

"That's mad," said Mella. 

"Yes, only scored thirty points too." 

Agda and Mella exchanged glances. 

"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting 
tonight. You can come along if you like." 


"Yeah, OK," said Ford. 



"I'd like to," said Arthur. 


Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise 
over the dull red glow of the trees. 

"That story about the world being destroyed..." began Mella. 

"In two million years, yes." 

"You say it as if you really think it's true." 

"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there." 

She shook her head in puzzlement. 

"You're very strange," she said. 

"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange things 
have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from than 
differing." 

"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got 
pushed into a black hole." 

"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the 
book." 

"What book?" 

Arthur paused. 

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. 

"What's that?" 

"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think 
I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.

LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND 
EVERYTHING 

for Sally 



Chapter 1 


The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur 
Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. 

It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp 
and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington 
and there wasn't a bus due for two million years. 

Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent 
could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At 
least being lost in space kept you busy. 

He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex 
sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown 
up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he ever 
dreamt existed, and though his life had now turned very, very, very 
quiet, he was still feeling jumpy. 

He hadn't been blown up now for five years. 

Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had 
parted company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in all 
that time either. 

Except just once. 

It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. 

He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he 
became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned 
and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue. 
Escape. The castaway's impossible dream - a ship. 

And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long 
silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without 
fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 

It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had 
generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm. 

A ramp extended itself. 

Light streamed out. 



A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down 
the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. 

"You're a jerk. Dent," it said simply. 

It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar 
alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly 
draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale 
grey-green alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which 
most grey-green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and 
very expensive soap. 

Arthur boggled at it. 

It gazed levelly at him. 

Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been 
overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling 
for the use of his vocal chords at this moment. 

"Whh...?" he said. 

"Bu... hu... uh..." he added. 

"Ru... ra... wah... who?" he managed finally to say and lapsed into a 
frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of having not said 
anything to anybody for as long as he could remember. 

The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to 
be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and 
spindly alien hand. 

"Arthur Dent?" it said. 

Arthur nodded helplessly. 

"Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. 

"Er... er... yes... er... er," confirmed Arthur. 

"You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole." 

"Er..." 

The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its 
clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship. 

"Er..." said Arthur desperately, "er..." 

"Don't give me that!" snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, 
through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship. The ship sealed 
itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum. 

"Er, hey!" shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. 

"Wait a minute!" he called. "What is this? What? Wait a minute!" 



The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, 
and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It 
passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was 
gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a 
helplessly tiny little dance. 

"What?" he screamed. "What? What? Hey, what? Come back here 
and say that!" 

He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his 
lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to 
hear him or speak to him. 

The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches 
of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which 
separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each 
other. 

Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back 
in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged. 

He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would 
have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at 
least keep him on the move. 

Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was - indeed, is - one of the 
Universe's very small number of immortal beings. 

Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with 
it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate 
them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality thrust 
upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle 
accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands. The precise 
details of the accident are not important because no one has ever 
managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it 
happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, 
or both, trying. 

Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put 
some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could have 
made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have 
done. 



To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking 
risks, cleaning up on high-yield long-term investments, and just 
generally outliving the hell out of everybody. 

In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and 
that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you 
know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, 
that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you 
will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning 
technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands 
will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long 
dark teatime of the soul. 

So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear 
at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the 
Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular. 

This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing 
which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would 
drive him on forever. It was this. 

He would insult the Universe. 

That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, 
one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth 
over) in alphabetical order. 

When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that 
the plan was not merely misGuided but actually impossible because 
of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would 
merely fix them with a steely look and say, "A man can dream can't 
he?" 

And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to 
last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing 
involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known 
Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. 

His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, 
preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into 
interstellar space. 

"Computer," he said. 

"Here," yipped the computer. 

"Where next?" 


"Computing that." 



Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the 
night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite 
darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. 
Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. 

He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots 
in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from 
some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very, 
very rude word. 

The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its 
calculations. 

"Folfanga," it said. It beeped. 

"Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it continued. It beeped 
again. 

"Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued further. It 
beeped again. 

"There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of the genus A-Rth- 
Urp-Hil-lpdenu." 

"I believe," it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, 
"that you had decided to call it a brainless prat." 

Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside 
his window for a moment or two. 

"I think I'll take a nap," he said, and then added, "what network 
areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?" 

The computer beeped. 

"Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box," it said, and beeped. 

"Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already?" 

"No." 

"Uh." 

"There's Angst in Space. You've only seen that thirty-three 
thousand five hundred and seventeen times." 

"Wake me for the second reel." 

The computer beeped. 

"Sleep well," it said. 

The ship fled on through the night. 



Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent 
sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his 
entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and 
swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. 

The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because 
he thought it would be useful to keep things in. 



Chapter 2 


This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as 
he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a 
better name for it or find a better cave. 

Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of 
horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped his 
dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the 
bright morning. 

The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the 
tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the 
butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature 
seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. 

It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so 
cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope 
with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his 
attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of 
his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad. 

He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from 
his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided 
formally to announce his decision. 

He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields 
and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his 
hair. He spread his arms out wide. 

"I will go mad!" he announced. 

"Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on 
which he had been sitting. 

Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups. 

"I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good." 

"You see," said Ford, 

"Where have you been?" interrupted Arthur, now that his head 
had finished working out. 



"Around," said Ford, "around and about." He grinned in what he 
accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. "I just took my mind 
off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly 
enough it would call back. It did." 

He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. 

"At least," he said, "I think it did. This has been playing up a bit." He 
shook it. "If it was a false alarm I shall go mad," he said, "again." 

Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. 

"I thought you must be dead..." he said simply. 

"So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided I was a lemon 
for a couple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time jumping in 
and out of a gin and tonic." 

Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again. 

"Where," he said, "did you...?" 

"Find a gin and tonic?" said Ford brightly. "I found a small lake that 
thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, 
I think it thought it was a gin and tonic." 

"I may," he added with a grin which would have sent sane men 
scampering into trees, "have been imagining it." 

He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than 
that. 

"Carry on," he said levelly. 

"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is no point in driving 
yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well 
give in and save your sanity for later." 

"And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I ask merely for 
information." 

"I went to Africa," said Ford. 

"Yes?" 

"Yes." 

"What was that like?" 

"And this is your cave is it?" said Ford. 

"Er, yes," said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years 
of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he 



could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately 
annoying person. 

"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You must 
hate it." 

Arthur didn't bother to reply. 

"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved very oddly 
there." 

Fie gazed thoughtfully into the distance. 

"I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily. "But only," he 
added, "as a hobby." 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily. 

"Yes," Ford assured him. "I won't disturb you with the details 
because they would - " 

"What?" 

"Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am 
singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you 
came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to learn to fly. 
Do you believe me?" 

"Tell me," said Arthur. 

"I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says..." 

"The...?" 

"Guide. The FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?" 

"Yes. I remember throwing it in the river." 

"Yes," said Ford, "but I fished it out." 

"You didn't tell me." 

"I didn't want you to throw it in again." 

"Fair enough," admitted Arthur. "It says?" 

"What?" 

"The Guide says?" 

"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather a 
knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground 
and miss." FHe smiled weakly. Fie pointed at the knees of his trousers 
and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn 
through. 



"I haven't done very well so far," he said. He stuck out his hand. 
"I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur," he added. 

Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and 
bewilderment. 

"I haven't seen anyone for years," he said, "not anyone. I can 
hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I 
practise you see. I practise by talking to... talking to... what are those 
things people think you're mad if you talk to? Like George the Third." 

"Kings?" suggested Ford. 

"No, no," said Arthur. "The things he used to talk to. We're 
surrounded by them for heaven's sake. I've planted hundreds myself. 
They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees. What's that for?" 

Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with 
incomprehension. 

"Shake," prompted Ford. 

Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. 
Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming 
flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. 

After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to 
the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around 
them. 

"What happened to the Golgafrinchans?" asked Ford. 

Arthur shrugged. 

"A lot of them didn't make it through the winter three years ago," 
he said, "and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a 
holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they must have 
survived..." 

"Huh," said Ford, "well well." He stuck his hands on his hips and 
looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about 
Ford a sense of energy and purpose. 

"We're going," he said excitedly, and shivered with energy. 

"Where? How?" said Arthur. 

"I don't know," said Ford, "but I just feel that the time is right. 
Things are going to happen. We're on our way." 

He lowered his voice to a whisper. 

"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash." 



He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite 
like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the 
wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. 

Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he 
hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. 

"The wash?" said Arthur. 

"The space-time wash," said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past 
at that moment, he bared his teeth into it. 

Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat. 

"Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of Vogon 
laundromat, or what are we talking about?" 

"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum." 

"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?" He pushed his hands into the 
pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the 
distance. 

"What?" said Ford. 

"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly?" 

Ford looked angrily at him. 

"Will you listen?" he snapped. 

"I have been listening," said Arthur, "but I'm not sure it's helped." 

Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to 
him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody 
from a telephone company accounts department. 

"There seem..." he said, "to be some pools..." he said, "of 
instability..." he said, "in the fabric..." he said... 

Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where 
Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the 
foolish look into a foolish remark. 

"... in the fabric of space-time," he said. 

"Ah, that," said Arthur. 

"Yes, that," confirmed Ford. 

They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared 
each other resolutely in the face. 

"And it's done what?" said Arthur. 

"It," said Ford, "has developed pools of instability." 



"Has it?" said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment. 

"It has," said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility. 

"Good," said Arthur. 

"See?" said Ford. 

"No," said Arthur. 

There was a quiet pause. 

"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort of 
pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer 
negotiating a tricky outcrop, "is that it's very different from most of 
the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with 
trees. They weren't like this. Except perhaps some of the ones I've 
had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down." 

"Arthur," said Ford. 

"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 

"Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very 
simple." 

"Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that." 

They sat down and composed their thoughts. 

Ford got out his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was making vague 
humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. 

"Flat battery?" said Arthur. 

"No," said Ford, "there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of 
space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in our 
vicinity." 

"Where?" 

Ford moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi-circle. 
Suddenly the light flashed. 

"There!" said Ford, shooting out his arm. "There, behind that sofa!" 

Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley- 
covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled 
intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. 

"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?" 

"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the space- 
time continuum!" 



"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, 
he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. 

"Arthur!" shouted Ford at him, "that sofa is there because of the 
space-time instability I've been trying to get your terminally softened 
brain to get to grips with. It's been washed out of the continuum, it's 
space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is, we've got to catch it, 
it's our only way out of here!" 

He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across 
the field. 

"Catch it?" muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he 
saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across 
the grass. 

With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock 
and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational 
piece of furniture. 

They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting 
instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. 
The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals 
scattered crazily in their wake. 

Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for 
once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes 
ago he had decided he would go mad, and now he was already 
chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. 

The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to 
be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a 
billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others. 

Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and 
weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, 
which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and span, and suddenly 
turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and 
they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt 
on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, 
and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord's Cricked 
Ground, St John's Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test 
Match of the Australian Series in the year 198-, with England needing 
only twenty-eight runs to win.

Chapter 3 


It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur 
tumbled haphazardly out of a space-time anomaly and hit the 
immaculate turf rather hard. 

The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but 
instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the 
small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding 
whistled mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man 
collapsed. 

They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin 
hideously around them. 

"What was that?" hissed Arthur. 

"Something red," hissed Ford back at him. 

"Where are we?" 

"Er, somewhere green." 

"Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes." 

The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of 
astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who 
could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what 
they had just seen or not. 

"This your sofa?" said a voice. 

"What was that?" whispered Ford. 

Arthur looked up. 

"Something blue," he said. 

"Shape?" said Ford. 

Arthur looked again. 

"It is shaped," he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowing, 
"like a policeman." 



They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning 
deeply. The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on 
the shoulders. 

"Come on, you two," the shape said, "let's be having you." 

These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his 
feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled 
glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled 
down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness. 

"Where did you get this from?" he yelled at the policeman shape. 

"What did you say?" said the startled shape. 

"This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it?" snapped Arthur. "Where did 
you find it, how did you get it here? I think," he added, clasping his 
hand to his brow, "that I had better calm down." He squatted down 
abruptly in front of Ford. 

"It is a policeman," he said, "What do we do?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"What do you want to do?" he said. 

"I want you," said Arthur, "to tell me that I have been dreaming for 
the last five years." 

Ford shrugged again, and obliged. 

"You've been dreaming for the last five years," he said. 

Arthur got to his feet. 

"It's all right, officer," he said. "I've been dreaming for the last five 
years. Ask him," he added, pointing at Ford, "he was in it." 

Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, 
brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing gown 
and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the policeman. 

"So where did I get these clothes from?" he howled. 

He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass. 

Ford shook his head. 

"He's had a bad two million years," he said to the policeman, and 
together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the 
pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of 
the sofa on the way. 



Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most of 
them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio 
instead. 

"Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian," said one radio 
commentator to another. "I don't think there have been any 
mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I don't 
think there have been any - have there? - that I recall?" 

"Edgbaston, 1932?" 

"Ah, now what happened then..." 

"Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to bowl 
from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across 
the pitch." 

There was a pause while the first commentator considered this. 

"Ye... e... s..." he said, "yes, there's nothing actually very mysterious 
about that, is there? He didn't actually materialize, did he? Just ran 
on." 

"No, that's true, but he did claim to have seen something 
materialize on the pitch." 

"Ah, did he?" 

"Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description." 

"Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?" 

"Apparently not. And no one was able to get a very detailed 
description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was 
made." 

"And what happened to the man?" 

"Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some 
lunch, but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one, so 
the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three 
wickets." 

"So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who've just 
tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er... two men, two 
rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa - a Chesterfield I 
think?" 


"Yes, a Chesterfield." 



"Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord's Cricket Ground. 
But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very good- 
natured about it, and..." 

"Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the sofa 
has just vanished." 

"So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely one for 
the record books I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic 
moment in play, England now needing only twenty-four runs to win 
the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police 
officer, and I think everyone's settling down now and play is about to 
resume." 

"Now, sir," said the policeman after they had made a passage 
through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body on a 
blanket, "perhaps you'd care to tell me who you are, where you come 
from, and what that little scene was all about?" 

Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for 
something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the 
policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six 
hundred light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home near 
Betelgeuse. 

"All right," said Ford, very quietly, "I'll tell you." 

"Yes, well, that won't be necessary," said the policeman hurriedly, 
"just don't let whatever it was happen again." The policeman turned 
around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn't from 
Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them. 

Arthur's consciousness approached his body as from a great 
distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there. Slowly, 
nervously, it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position. 

Arthur sat up. 

"Where am I?" he said. 

"Lord's Cricket Ground," said Ford. 

"Fine," said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a 
quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass. 

Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment 
tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face. 


"How're you feeling?" said Ford. 



"I'm home," said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily 
inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was-well, as far as Arthur was 
concerned, as if it was tea, which it was. 

"I'm home," he repeated, "home. It's England, it's today, the 
nightmare is over." He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely. 

"I'm where I belong," he said in an emotional whisper. 

"There are two things I fell which I should tell you," said Ford, 
tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him. 

"I'm home," said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford. "One is," he said pointing at the date at the top of 
the paper, "that the Earth will be demolished in two days' time." 

"I'm home," said Arthur. "Tea," he said, "cricket," he added with 
pleasure, "mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer 
cans..." 

Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on 
one side with a slight frown. 

"I've seen that one before," he said. His eyes wandered slowly up 
to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a second 
or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which 
Arctic ice - floes do so spectacularly in the spring. 

"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to have a bone 
in your beard." He tossed back his tea. 

Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy 
crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice lollies and 
melted them. It shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies 
had just melted and fallen off the stick. It shone on the trees, it 
flashed off whirling cricket bats, it gleamed off the utterly 
extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight-screens and 
which nobody appeared to have noticed. It beamed on Ford and 
Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and 
surveyed the scene around them. 

Arthur was shaking. 

"Perhaps," he said, "I should..." 

"No," said Ford sharply. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Don't try and phone yourself up at home." 



"How did you know...?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"But why not?" said Arthur. 

"People who talk to themselves on the phone," said Ford, "never 
learn anything to their advantage." 

"But..." 

"Look," said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an 
imaginary dial. 

"Hello?" he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "Is that Arthur 
Dent? Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don't hang up." 

He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment. 

"He hung up," he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone 
neatly back on its imaginary hook. 

"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added. 

A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's 
face. 

"So we're not home and dry," he said. 

"We could not even be said," replied Ford, "to be home and 
vigorously towelling ourselves off." 

The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, 
a trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and 
legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and thwacked it 
behind him over the sight-screens. Ford's eyes followed the trajectory 
of the ball and jogged momentarily. He stiffened. He looked along the 
flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again. 

"This isn't my towel," said Arthur, who was rummaging in his 
rabbit-skin bag. 

"Shhh," said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration. 

"I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel," continued Arthur, "it was 
blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it." 

"Shhh," said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the 
other. 

"This one's pink," said Arthur, "it isn't yours is it?" 

"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford. 

"It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is the point I am trying 



"And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it," 
continued Ford in a low growl, "is now." 

"All right," said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively 
stitched rabbit-skin bag. "I realize that it is probably not important in 
the cosmic scale of things, it's just odd, that's all. A pink towel 
suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars." 

Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not 
actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a 
way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in 
which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this. 
Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow 
members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his 
hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind 
some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and 
blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk 
forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of 
concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether it's just seen a 
half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty 
plain. 

"This isn't my bag either," said Arthur suddenly. 

Ford's spell of concentration was broken. Fie turned angrily on 
Arthur. 

"I wasn't talking about my towel," said Arthur. "We've established 
that that isn't mine. It's just that the bag into which I was putting the 
towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily 
similar. Now personally I think that that is extremely odd, especially 
as the bag was one I made myself on prehistoric Earth. These are also 
not my stones," he added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. 
"I was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly 
very dull ones." 

A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated 
whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. 

The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and 
dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit-skin bag. 

"Now I would say that that was also a very curious event," said 
Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on 
the ground. 



"I don't think it's here," he said to the small boys who immediately 
clustered round him to join in the search, "it probably rolled off 
somewhere. Over there I expect." He pointed vaguely in the direction 
in which he wished they would push off. One of the boys looked at 
him quizzically. 

"You all right?" said the boy. 

"No," said Arthur. 

"Then why you got a bone in your beard?" said the boy. 

"I'm training it to like being wherever it's put." Arthur prided 
himself on saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing 
which would entertain and stimulate young minds. 

"Oh," said the small boy, putting his head to one side and thinking 
about it. "What's your name?" 

"Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent." 

"You're a jerk. Dent," said the boy, "a complete asshole." The boy 
looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in any 
particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his 
nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be 
demolished again in two days' time, and just this once didn't feel too 
bad about it. 

Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford 
continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking. 

"Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur. 

"I think," said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now 
recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible, 
"that there's an SEP over there." 

He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not 
the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, 
which was towards the sight-screens, and in the other which was at 
the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He shrugged again. 

"A what?" he said. 

"An SEP." 

"AnS...?" 

"... EP." 

"And what's that?" 


"Somebody Else's Problem." 



"Ah, good," said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that 
was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't. 

"Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and 
looking at the pitch. 

"Where?" said Arthur. 

"There!" said Ford. 

"I see," said Arthur, who didn't. 

"You do?" said Ford. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the SEP?" 

"I thought you said that was somebody else's problem." 

"That's right." 

Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense 
stupidity. 

"And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it." 

"You do?" 

"Yes." 

"What," said Arthur, "does it look like?" 

"Well, how should I know, you fool?" shouted Ford. "If you can see 
it, you tell me." 

Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the 
temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with 
Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took 
him by the arm. 

"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see, or 
our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody 
else's problem. That's what SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. 

The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly 
you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope 
is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why..." 

"Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say. 

"... you've been jumping up and..." 

"Yes." 


"... down, and blinking..." 



"Yes." 

"...and..." 

"I think you've got the message." 

"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship." 

For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation 
provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction 
people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a 
tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced 
fearfully around. Then he glanced around again in even greater 
astonishment. 

"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in 
front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that 
Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth 
wobbled as well. 

"W... w... w... w..." his mouth said. 

"I think your team have just won," said the apparition. 

"W... w... w... w..." repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble 
with a prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at the tumult in 
trepidation. 

"You are English, aren't you?" said the apparition. 

"W... w... w... w... yes" said Arthur. 

"Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means they 
retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I'm rather 
fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone outside this planet to 
hear me saying that. Oh dear no." 

The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a 
mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly 
behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating 
his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic and 
hard to reconcile with mischievous grins. 

"Still," he said, "it'll all be over in a couple of days, won't it? Though 
as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that. Still, 
whatever will have been, will have been." 

Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He 
prodded Ford again. 



"I thought something terrible had happened," said Ford, "but it's 
just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello, 

Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?" 

"Oh, pottering, pottering," said the old man gravely. 

"That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?" 

"Patience, patience," the old man admonished. 

"OK," said Ford. "It's just that this planet's going to be demolished 
pretty soon." 

"I know that," said Slartibartfast. 

"And, well, I just wanted to make that point," said Ford. 

"The point is taken." 

And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch 
at this point..." 

"I do." 

"Then it's your ship." 

"It is." 

"I suppose." Ford turned away sharply at this point. 

"Flello, Slartibartfast," said Arthur at last. 

"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast. 

"After all," said Ford, "we can only die once." 

The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with 
eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing 
on what was happening out there. What was happening was that the 
crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the 
pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone knew. 

Ford was humming something. It was just one note repeated at 
intervals. He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was 
humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he would have 
said he was humming the first line of a Noel Coward song called "Mad 
About the Boy" over and over again. It would then have been pointed 
out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he would have 
replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent, he was 
omitting the "about the boy" bit. Fie was annoyed that nobody asked. 

"It's just," he burst out at last, "that if we don't go soon, we might 
get caught in the middle of it all again. And there's nothing that 
depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed. Except 



possibly still being on it when it happens. Or," he added in an 
undertone, "hanging around cricket matches." 

"Patience," said Slartibartfast again. "Great things are afoot." 

"That's what you said last time we met," said Arthur. 

"They were," said Slartibartfast. 

"Yes, that's true," admitted Arthur. 

All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some 
kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather than the 
spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were 
standing was what they heard from a nearby radio. Ford was 
aggressively uninterested. 

He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be 
presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the pitch, 
fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for 
the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information 
that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when, 
further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket 
stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to 
signify the "death of English cricket", he rounded on Slartibartfast, 
took a deep breath, but didn't have a chance to say anything because 
the old man wasn't there. He was marching out on to the pitch with 
terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard and robes swept behind 
him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been 
a well-cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery 
smoking mountain. 

"He said to meet him at his ship," said Arthur. 

"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?" 
exploded Ford. 

"Meeting us at his ship in two minutes," said Arthur with a shrug 
which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off towards 
it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but 
could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding 
that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he 
said, "vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the 
Galaxy", and that this was causing wild hilarity. They resolved to 
ignore it. 



What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a 
hundred thousand people saying "wop", a steely white spaceship 
suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly 
above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a 
slight hum. 

Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go 
about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there. 

Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened up 
and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite 
extraordinary things. 

They were robots, white robots. 

What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared 
to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but 
they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but 
they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that 
but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs. 
These last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets 
which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their 
hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did 

"Hello," said Arthur, "something seems to be happening." 

"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know, I don't want 
to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is not my 
planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to get involved, just 
get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate 
to!" 

Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch. 

"Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force 
here today..." burbled a radio happily to itself. 

"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous 
remarks, "is a strong drink and a peer-group." He continued to run, 
pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag him along 
with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to 
stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him. 

"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after 
Ford. "I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are 
doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just killing 



people, they're sending them up," he shouted, "Ford, they're sending 
us up!" 

It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great 
deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up 
in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen 
moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a 
series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that 
every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed. 

The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur's initial reaction, that 
the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian 
margarine manufacturers. 

And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven 
white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight 
formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of 
their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred 
thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the thin air 
out of which it had wopped. 

For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of 
the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking 
even more like Moses because in spite of the continued absence of 
the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking 
well-mown lawn. 

Fie stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of 
Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened 
crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite 
direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an 
unusual day this was turning out to be, and not really knowing which 
way, if any, to turn. 

Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at Ford and Arthur and 
shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his 
ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still apparently 
unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had 
enough of their own problems to cope with at that time. 

"They've garble warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast in his thin 
tremulous voice. 

"What did he say?" panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards. 

Arthur shook his head. 



"'They've...' something or other," he said. 

"They've table warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast again. 

Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other. 

"It sounds urgent," said Arthur. He stopped and shouted. 

"What?" 

"They've garble warble fashes!" cried Slartibartfast, still waving at 
them. 

"He says," said Arthur, "that they've taken the Ashes. That is what I 
think he says." They ran on. 

"The...?" said Ford. 

"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt remains of a cricket stump. 
It's a trophy. That..." he was panting, "is... apparently... what they... 
have come and taken." He shook his head very slightly as if he was 
trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull. 

"Strange thing to want to tell us," snapped Ford. 

"Strange thing to take." 

"Strange ship." 

They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship 
was watching the Somebody Else's Problem field at work. They could 
now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it 
was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. 
This wasn't because it was actually invisible or anything hyper¬ 
impossible like that. The technology involved in making anything 
invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-nine 
thousand million, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred 
and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of 
a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing 
away and do without it. The ultra-famous sciento-magician Effrafax of 
Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great 
megamountain Magramal entirely invisible. 

Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-O- 
Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he 
realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it. 

So, he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his friends' 
friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some 
rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major 
stellar trucking company, put in what now is widely recognized as 



being the hardest night's work in history, and, sure enough, on the 
following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet - 
and therefore his life - simply because some pedantic adjudicating 
official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal 
ought to be he didn't trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) 
a suspicious-looking extra moon. 

The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more 
effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a 
single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural 
disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, 
or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected 
a cheap and simple Somebody Else's Problem field on it, then people 
would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and 
simply never have noticed that the thing was there. 

And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's ship. 

It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its 
visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything. 

The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly 
like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape 
hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro. 

Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply 
offended sensibilities. 

"Yes, I know," said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, 
breathless and agitated, "but there is a reason. Come, we must go. 
The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom confronts us all. We must 
leave at once." 

"I fancy somewhere sunny," said Ford. 

Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so 
perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware 
of what happened next outside. 

A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, 
descended from the sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long 
legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 

It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey-green figure 
marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who 
were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of 
the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people aside with quiet. 



understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate 
pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, 
breathing, coughing his last. The figure knelt down quietly beside him. 

"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure. 

The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly. 

"You're a no-good dumbo nothing," whispered the creature. "I 
thought you should know that before you went." 


Important facts from Galactic history, number two: 

(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular 
Galactic History.) 

Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, 
risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to 
think that life in the Galaxy must be: 

(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick, time sick, history sick or 
some such thing, and 

(b) stupid. 



Chapter 4 


It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside 
and let them through. 

It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the 
cosmos were streaming through each other. 

It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, 
and that the wind was him. 

It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe 
and that the Universe was a thought of his. 

It seemed to the people at Lord's Cricket Ground that another 
North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, 
and that this was Somebody Else's Problem. 

"What happened?" whispered Arthur in considerable awe. 

"We took off," said Slartibartfast. 

Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn't 
certain whether he had just got space-sickness or religion. 

"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the 
degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast's ship 
had just done, "shame about the decor." 

For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at 
the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert 
fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down. 
Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide 
panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering 
complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them. 

His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his 
eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression 
merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. 
He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a moment, then he 
relaxed. 



"It's a mistake to try and understand mathematics," he said, "they 
only worry me. What did you say?" 

"Decor," said Ford. "Pity about it." 

"Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe," said 
Slartibartfast, "there is a reason." 

Ford glanced sharply around. Fie clearly thought this was taking an 
optimistic view of things. 

The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, 
cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small 
Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small pools of light 
picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable 
brass things. 

Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows. 

The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast's attention 
seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in 
concrete. 

Ford reached out and touched it. 

Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete. 

The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running 
jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand, it 
could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the Fleart 
of Gold seem like an electric pram. 

Fie swung himself off the couch. Fie brushed himself down. Fie 
looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself. Fie looked at the 
screen and recognized nothing. Fie looked at Slartibartfast. 

"Flow far did we just travel?" he said. 

"About..." said Slartibartfast, "about two thirds of the way across 
the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two thirds, I 
think." 

"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly, "that the further and 
faster one travels across the Universe, the more one's position in it 
seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with a profound, or 
rather emptied of a..." 

"Yes, very strange," said Ford. "Where are we going?" 

"We are going," said Slartibartfast, "to confront an ancient 
nightmare of the Universe." 



"And where are you going to drop us off?" 

"I will need your help." 

"Tough. Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can 
have fun. I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen 
to some extremely evil music. Hold on. I'll look it up." He dug out his 
copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped through 
those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and 
rock and roll. 

"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast. 

"Yes, I expect so," said Ford. "Hey," he said, lighting accidentally on 
one particular reference entry, "Eccentrica Gallumbits, did you ever 
meet her? The triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say 
her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Me, 

I disagree, I say five." 

"A curse," said Slartibartfast, "which will engulf the Galaxy in fire 
and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature 
doom. I mean it," he added. 

"Sounds like a bad time," said Ford, "with luck I'll be drunk enough 
not to notice. Here," he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the 
Guide, "would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should. 
What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention. 
There's important stuff you're missing here." 

Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head. 

"Where are we going?" he said. 

"To confront an ancient night - " 

"Can it," said Ford. "Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to 
have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?" 

"What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?" said Arthur. 

"Nothing," said Ford. 

"Doom," said Slartibartfast. "Come," he added, with sudden 
authority, "there is much I must show and tell you." 

He walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set 
incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to 
ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed. 

Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel. 



"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a 
natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and that I 
am therefore excused from saving Universes." 

Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them. 

What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford 
shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot 
plant, crushing it against the wall. 

"The central computational area," said Slartibartfast unperturbed, 
"this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is 
performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex 
four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex 
mathematical functions." 

"It looks like a joke," said Arthur. 

"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As 
he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but 
he refused to believe it. The Universe could not possibly work like that, 
he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as 
absurd as... he terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really 
absurd things he could think of had already happened. 

And this was one of them. 

It was a large glass cage, or box-in fact a room. 

In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a 
dozen chairs, of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth - a grubby, 
red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette 
burn, each, presumably, at a precise calculated mathematical position. 

And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian meals, hedged 
about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and 
toyed with listlessly by robots. 

It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended 
by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot maetre d'. The 
furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular 
piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical 
characteristics of, say, a polio sorpreso, without actually being one. 

And all participated in a little dance together - a complex routine 
involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, 
credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be 



hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually 
getting anywhere. 

Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day 
quite idly with the maetre d', whilst one of the customer robots, an 
autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to 
do to some guy over some girl. 

Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and 
passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round 
the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments 
broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved 
fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other's pieces 
of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the bill pad more 
quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly 
than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated. Soon, an 
extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and 
seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly 
achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship. 

Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room. 

"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational force 
known to parascience. Come to the Room of Informational Illusions." 

He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake. 



Chapter 5 


The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast 
interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with 
Improbability Factors. 

Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of 
understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed 
that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's 
movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but 
depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now realized 
that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's 
movement in restaurants. 

The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom 
the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three 
telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation 
to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of 
people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, 
or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has 
turned up. 

The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which 
is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical 
concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only 
be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the 
given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is 
impossible that any member of the party will arrive. 
Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, 
including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations 
used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field. 

The third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all lies 
in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost 
of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are 
each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually 
brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field.) 



The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point 
remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took 
them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as 
politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or 
the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the 
following morning. They were never tested under laboratory 
conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories - 
not in reputable laboratories at least. 

And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the 
startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: 

Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of 
restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers 
written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the 
Universe. 

This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely 
revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such 
good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died 
of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by 
years. 

Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be 
understood. To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much 
what the man in the street would have said, "Oh yes, I could have told 
you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive Subjectivity 
Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get 
on with it. 

The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the 
major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the 
Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually 
given a street theatre grant and went away. 



Chapter 6 


"In space travel, you see," said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled with 
some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, "in space 
travel..." 

He stopped and looked about him. 

The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the 
visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There was 
nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls 
and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to 
plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn't find. 

"Yes?" urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast's sense of 
urgency but didn't know what to do with it. 

"Yes what?" said the old man. 

"You were saying?" 

Slartibartfast looked at him sharply. 

"The numbers," he said, "are awful." He resumed his search. 

Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this 
wasn't getting him anywhere and decided that he would say "what?" 
after all. 

"In space travel," repeated Slartibartfast, "all the numbers are 
awful." 

Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford 
was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it. 

"I was only," said Slartibartfast with a sigh, "trying to save you the 
trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were being done 
on a waiter's bill pad." 

Arthur frowned. 

"Why," he said, "were all the ship's computations being done on a 
wait-" 

He stopped. 



Slartibartfast said, "Because in space travel all the numbers are 
awful." 

He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across. 

"Listen," he said. "On a waiter's bill pad numbers dance. You must 
have encountered the phenomenon." 

"Well..." 

"On a waiter's bill pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and unreality 
collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and 
anything is possible, within certain parameters." 

"What parameters?" 

"It's impossible to say," said Slartibartfast. "That's one of them. 
Strange but true. At least, I think it's strange," he added, "and I'm 
assured that it's true." 

At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had 
been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it. 

"Do not be alarmed," he said, and then suddenly darted an 
alarmed look at himself, and lunged back, "it's..." 

They didn't hear what he said, because at that moment the ship 
winked out of existence around them and a starbattle-ship the size of 
a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night 
towards them, star lasers ablaze. 

They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream. 



Chapter 7 


Another world, another day, another dawn. 

The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. 

Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei 
rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and 
slightly damp. 

There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the 
possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. 

The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta, 
without incident. 

The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees 
were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless like held 
breath. 

Nothing moved. 

There was silence. 

The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little 
warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly today was going to 
be just another long haul across the sky. 

Nothing moved. 

Again, silence. 

Nothing moved. 

Silence. 

Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would go on like 
this, and this was indeed going to be one of them. 

Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite 
horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort. 

And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders and 
started on up the sky again. 

This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just 
met a robot. 



"Hello, robot," said the mattress. 

"Bleah," said the robot and continued what it was doing, which was 
walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle. 

"Happy?" said the mattress. 

The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it 
quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked back at him 
with wide eyes. 

After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as 
being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general 
contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round 
in tight circles. 

"We could have a conversation," said the mattress, "would you like 
that?" 

It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality. 

Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an 
infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, 
most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would 
rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in 
which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The life 
cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting. Once picked it 
needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. 
Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which 
crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal 
object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole 
for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows 
what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is 
presumably working on it. 

No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their 
lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures which 
live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squornshellous Zeta. Many of 
them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out and slept on. 
None of them seem to mind and all of them are called Zem. 

"No," said Marvin. 

"My name," said the mattress, "is Zem. We could discuss the 
weather a little." 

Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod. 



"The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with a particularly 
sickening thud this morning." 

He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst 
to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. 

If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He 
hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all. 

The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live 
mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in 
more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, 
moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few bubbles up 
through the water engagingly. Its blue and white stripes glistened 
briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it 
through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily. 

Marvin plodded. 

"You have something on your mind, I think," said the mattress 
floopily. 

"More than you can possibly imagine," dreaded Marvin. "My 
capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite 
reaches of space itself. Except of course for my capacity for 
happiness." 

Stomp, stomp, he went. 

"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a 
matchbox without taking out the matches first." 

The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp¬ 
dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy. 
The word can also, according to the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon 
Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise made by the Lord 
High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his 
wife's birthday for the second year running. Since there was only ever 
one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and he never married, the word 
is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense, and there is an 
ever-increasing body of opinion which holds that the Ultra-Complete 
Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to 
cart its microstored edition around in. Strangely enough, the 
dictionary omits the word "floopily", which simply means "in the 
manner of something which is floopy". 

The mattress globbered again. 



"I sense a deep dejection in your diodes," it vollued (for the 
meaning of the word "vollue", buy a copy of Squornshellous 
Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively buy the 
Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very 
glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots), 
"and it saddens me. You should be more mattresslike. We live quiet 
retired lives in the swamp, where we are content to flollop and vollue 
and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner. Some of us are 
killed, but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which and 
globbering is thus kept to a minimum. Why are you walking in 
circles?" 

"Because my leg is stuck," said Marvin simply. 

"It seems to me," said the mattress eyeing it compassionately, 

"that it is a pretty poor sort of leg." 

"You are right," said Marvin, "it is." 

"Voon," said the mattress. 

"I expect so," said Marvin, "and I also expect that you find the idea 
of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should tell your 
friends Zem and Zem when you see them later; they'll laugh, if I know 
them, which I don't of course - except insofar as I know all organic life 
forms, which is much better than I would wish to. Ha, but my life is 
but a box of wormgears." 

He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel 
peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck. 

"But why do you just keep walking round and round?" said the 
mattress. 

"Just to make the point," said Marvin, and continued, round and 
round. 

"Consider it made, my dear friend," flurbled the mattress, 

"consider it made." 

"Just another million years," said Marvin, "just another quick 
million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you 
understand." 

The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that 
the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in 
this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did 
so. 



"Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over," said 
Marvin airily. "Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me." 

The mattress did. 

Marvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added 
emphasis. 

"I gave a speech once," he said suddenly, and apparently 
unconnectedly. "You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, 
but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at 
a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me 
give you an example. Think of a number, any number." 

"Er, five," said the mattress. 

"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?" 

The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was 
in the presence of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along its 
entire length, sending excited little ripples through its shallow algae- 
covered pool. 

It gupped. 

"Tell me," it urged, "of the speech you once made, I long to hear 
it." 

"It was received very badly," said Marvin, "for a variety of reasons. 

I delivered it," he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort 
of gesture with his not-exactly-good arm, but his arm which was 
better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his 
left side, "over there, about a mile distance." 

He was pointing as well as he could manage, and he obviously 
wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could 
manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh 
which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. 

"There," he repeated. "I was somewhat of a celebrity at the time." 

Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches 
being delivered on Squornshellous Zeta, and certainly not by 
celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill glurried across its back. 

It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. 
Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved 
it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it 
peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh 
which Marvin had indicated, observing, without disappointment, that 



it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. The effort 
was too much, and it flodged back into its pool, deluging Marvin with 
smelly mud, moss and weeds. 

"I was a celebrity," droned the robot sadly, "for a short while on 
account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate 
almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. You can guess 
from my condition," he added, "how narrow my escape was. I was 
rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that. Here I am, brain the 
size of... never mind." 

He trudged savagely for a few seconds. 

"He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't it? He sold 
me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a box and tell 
my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive. 'Give 
us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me, 'give us a little 
chuckle.' I would explain to them that to get my face to grin would 
take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench, and that 
went down very well." 

"The speech," urged the mattress. "I long to hear of the speech you 
gave in the marshes." 

"There was a bridge built across the marshes. A cyberstructured 
hyperbridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion-buggies and 
freighters over the swamp." 

"A bridge?" quirruled the mattress. "Here in the swamp?" 

"A bridge," confirmed Marvin, "here in the swamp. It was going to 
revitalize the economy of the Squornshellous System. They spent the 
entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it. They asked 
me to open it. Poor fools." 

It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist. 

"I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me, and 
hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched." 

"Did it glitter?" enthused the mattress. 

"It glittered." 

"Did it span the miles majestically?" 

"It spanned the miles majestically." 

"Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?" 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Do you want to hear this story?" 



"I want to hear your speech," said the mattress. 

"This is what I said. I said, 'I would like to say that it is a very great 
pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't 
because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise 
you all. I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the 
unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her.' And I plugged 
myself into the opening circuits." 

Marvin paused, remembering the moment. 

The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and 
willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. 

"Voon," it wurfed at last. "And it was a magnificent occasion?" 

"Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge 
spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into 
the mire, taking everybody with it." 

There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation 
during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say 
"wop" and a team of white robots descended from the sky like 
dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a 
sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching 
Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, 
which said "foop". 

"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?" said Marvin to 
the gobbering mattress. 

Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another 
violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone 
in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He 
almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over the reeds, but 
there was nothing to see, just more reeds. He listened, but there was 
no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half-crazed 
etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire. 



Chapter 8 


The body of Arthur Dent span. 

The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, 
and each particular shard span silently through the void, reflecting on 
its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction. 

And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each 
particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell. 

And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe 
erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the 
shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man 
speaking immense words. 

"These, then," said the figure, speaking from an immensely 
comfortable chair, "were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation 
ever visited upon our Galaxy. What you have experienced..." 

Slartibartfast floated past, waving. 

"It's just a documentary," he called out. "This is not a good bit. 
Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control..." 

"... is what billions of billions of innocent..." 

"Do not," called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling 
furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of 
Informational Illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, "agree 
to buy anything at this point." 

"... people, creatures, your fellow beings..." 

Music swelled - again, it was immense music, immense chords. 

And behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of 
the immensely swirling mist. 

"... experienced, lived through - or, more often, failed to live 
through. Think of that, my friends. And let us not forget - and in just a 
moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to 
remember - that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy was that rare 
and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy!" 



The music was going bananas with immensity at this point. 

"A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the 
WikkitGate!" 

The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with 
two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to 
Arthur's addled brain. 

"The three pillars," thundered the man. "The Steel Pillar which 
represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!" 

Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the 
pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something very 
like it. The music thumped and bellowed. 

"The Perspex Pillar," announced the man, "representing the forces 
of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!" 

Other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand, 
transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden 
inexplicable craving for ice-cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent. 

"And," the thunderous voice continued, "the Wooden Pillar, 
representing..." and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse 
with wonderful sentiments, "the forces of Nature and Spirituality." 

The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely up 
into the realms of complete unspeakability. 

"Between them supporting," the voice rolled on, approaching its 
climax, "the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace!" 

The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the 
music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the 
discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming 
bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, 
or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are usually 
represented as wearing more than that, though. 

Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably 
meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights. 

"There is not a world," thrilled the man's expert voice, "not a 
civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even 
today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories. This it 
was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks 
their world away till the end of eternity!" 



And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the 
Wikkit gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole 
extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been 
about three feet high. 

"Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was 
destroyed, blasted into the ever-whirling eddies of the space-time 
continuum and lost for ever. This is a remarkable replica, hand-tooled 
by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets 
into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who 
fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy - our Galaxy - which they died to 
defend..." 

Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment. 

"Found it," he said. "We can lose all this rubbish. Just don't nod, 
that's all." 

"Now, let us bow our heads in payment," intoned the voice, and 
then said it again, much faster and backwards. 

Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabled 
himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled 
itself around them. 

"You get the gist?" said Slartibartfast. 

"I'm astonished," said Arthur, "and bewildered." 

"I was asleep," said Ford, who floated into view at this point. "Did I 
miss anything?" 

They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the 
edge of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from their 
faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest 
and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy 
was briskly burning itself back into existence. The sky was a sullen 
pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to 
black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick. 

Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be 
distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle-ship 
rushed away from them as if they'd said "boo", they only just 
recognized it as the point at which they had come in. 

But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed 
and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning, 
twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill. 



Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed 
appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these 
were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images 
which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of tumbling history: a 
wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also 
something less distinct, something dark and cloudy. 

But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the 
thrilling passage of time. 

Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the 
definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of 
a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here 
took on the quality of a sustained emotion - and yet not an emotion. 

If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one. It was hatred, 
implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is 
cold. It was impersonal, not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is 
impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is 
impersonal. And it was deadly - again, not like a bullet or a knife is 
deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly. 

And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on 
harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to 
rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a 
scream of guilt and failure. 

And suddenly it stopped. 


They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening. 

The sun was setting. 

All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off 
gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of it all, 
and the general opinion seemed to be good. A little way away could 
be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than 
the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming 
evening light the outlines of a small town. 

The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made 
of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves. 

The sun had nearly set. 



As if out of nowhere, music began. Slartibartfast tugged at a switch 
and it stopped. 

A voice said, "This..." Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it 
stopped. 

"I will tell you about it," he said quietly. 

The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed 
cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and 
the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under 
their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet 
and fragrant. Only Slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of 
sorts. 

He stopped and looked up. 

It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the end, 
so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just 
blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about to happen. He 
was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to 
somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up. There was nothing in 
the sky. 

"They're not about to attack here, are they?" he said. He realized 
that this was merely a recording he was walking through, but he still 
felt alarmed. 

"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice 
which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. "This is where it all 
started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit." 

He stared up into the sky. 

The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from 
north to south, was utterly and completely black. 



Chapter 9 


Stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"Pleased to be of service." 

"Shut up." 

"Thank you." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"Thank you for making a simple door very happy." 

"Hope your diodes rot." 

"Thank you. Have a nice day." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"It is my pleasure to open for you..." 

"Zark off." 

"... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job 
well done." 

"I said zark off." 

"Thank you for listening to this message." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

"Wop." 

Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the 
Heart of Gold for days, and so far no door had said "wop" to him. He 
was fairly certain that no door had said "wop" to him now. It was not 
the sort of thing doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there were not 
enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said 
"wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship. 

It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed 
down. It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the inky 



blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand people 
would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected "wop"? 

He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It was 
all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish outlines of 
the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, 
though he had tried every way he could think of stopping them. 

The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each 
other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging 
sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking 
into his soul. 

It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night - of course. 

It had been a difficult day - of course. 

There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system - 
of course. 

And he had, of course, been slightly drunk. 

In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of 
soul-searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly been an 
error. 

Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered 
the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his other 
the other and each decided that the other was the way to go. 

He listened but could hear nothing. 

All there had been was the "wop". 

It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of 
people just to say one word. 

He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge. 
There at least he would feel in control. He stopped again. The way he 
was feeling he didn't think he was an awfully good person to be in 
control. 

The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been 
discovering that he actually had a soul. 

In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had one as he had 
a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, 
but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep 
within him had giving him a severe jolt. 



And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn't the 
totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a 
natural right to expect had jolted him again. 

Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the 
renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it 
quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another 
quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right. 

"Freedom," he said aloud. 

Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several 
enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom. 

"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to 
see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first. 
He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the 
right. 

He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would 
head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together 
they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would 
go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of 
a sing as well. 

He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all 
that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth 
for moral support. 

"You're drinking too much," said Trillian. 

His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now 
see into a whole position. He gave up and looked at the navigation 
screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of 
stars. 

"Excitement and adventure and really wild things," he muttered. 

"Look," she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near 
him, "it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a little 
aimless for a bit." 

He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap 
before. 

"Wow," he said. He had another drink. 

"You've finished the mission you've been on for years." 

"I haven't been on it. I've tried to avoid being on it." 



"You’ve still finished it." 

He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his 
stomach. 

"I think it finished me," he said. "Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I 
can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the know 
sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well..." 

"Are they?" 

"As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships..." 

Trillian raised her eyebrows. 

"I am," he added, "one hell of a guy, I can do anything I want only I 
just don’t have the faintest idea what." 

He paused. 

"One thing," he further added, "has suddenly ceased to lead to 
another" - in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid 
gracelessly off his chair. 

Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship's copy 
of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some advice to offer on 
drunkenness. 

"Go to it," it said, "and good luck." 

It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the 
Universe and ways of coping with that. 

Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet, 
and one of the wonders of the Galaxy. 

Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-luxury 
hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural 
erosion of wind and rain. 

The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity 
against. Little is known of how this came about because none of the 
geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or 
bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there. 

Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great 
white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky 
beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy 
spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, 
and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod moving around 
and whistling somewhere in the ship. 



"How are you?" she said over the general intercom. 

"Fine," he said brightly, "terribly well." 

"Where are you?" 

"In the bathroom." 

"What are you doing?" 

"Staying here." 

After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship 
returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway. 

"Heigh ho," said Eddie the Computer. 

Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and 
pushed the intercom switch. 

"I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this 
point." 

"Probably not," replied Zaphod from wherever he was. 

"I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of 
yourself." 

"Whatever you think, I think," said Zaphod. 

"RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES" was a heading which caught 
Trillian's eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through 
the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable 
speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something 
undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser and read about how 
to fly. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject 
of flying. 

There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying. 

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and 
miss. 

Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it. 

The first part is easy. 

All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all 
your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. 

That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. 

Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying 
properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. 



Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which presents the 
difficulties. 

One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's 
no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. 
You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something 
else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking 
about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to 
hurt if you fail to miss it. 

It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these 
three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence 
most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this 
exhilarating and spectacular sport. 

If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention 
momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair 
of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal 
inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly 
spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby 
twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely 
and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to 
be a slightly foolish manner. 

This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. 

Bob and float, float and bob. 

Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let 
yourself waft higher. 

Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because 
they are unlikely to say anything helpful. 

They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good God, 
you can't possibly be flying!" 

It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be 
right. 

Waft higher and higher. 

Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops 
breathing regularly. 

DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY. 

When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of 
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve. 



You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your 
flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in 
not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just 
allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway. 

You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you 
will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt. 

There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve 
the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with 
surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and 
exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments. Few genuine 
hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may 
be able to get temporary employment at them. 

Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod 
wasn't really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for 
walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan Civil 
Service to acknowledge a change-of-address card, which were the 
other things listed under the heading "RECREATIONAL 
IMPOSSIBILITIES". 

Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of ice, 
snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from the 
snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of 
Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of 
Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in 
the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far 
ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind and 
then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, 
and Trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her 
mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty. 

They went into a low orbit. 

There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath 
them. 

Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the 
other doing crosswords till late into the night. 

Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high 
number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get 
Zaphod talking. 



She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen 
synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive - 
delicately oiled meals, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran 
wines. 

She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things 
through. 

"Zark off," said Zaphod. 

Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher 
number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room 
and just teleported herself the hell out of his life. 

She didn't even programme any coordinates, she hadn't the 
faintest idea where she was going, she just went - a random row of 
dots flowing through the Universe. 

"Anything," she said to herself as she left, "is better than this." 

"Good job too," muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and 
failed to go to sleep. 

The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, 
pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there. He 
ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the 
hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across 
a pair of its terminals. 

After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing 
to see. Nothing was about to happen. 

Lying in bed one night - and night was now virtually continuous on 
the ship - he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some 
kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. 
He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more 
wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to 
set out and find him. 

Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, 
and he returned to bed. 

It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately 
about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he 
heard the "wop" said, and it made him very nervous. 

He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man 
trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his fingertips 
against the wall and felt an unusual vibration. And now he could quite 



clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming 
from - they were coming from the bridge. 

"Computer?" he hissed. 

"Mmmm?" said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly. 

"Is there someone on this ship?" 

"Mmmmm," said the computer. 

"Who is it?" 

Mmmmm mmm mmmmm," said the computer. 

"What?" 

"Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm." 

Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands. 

"Oh, Zarquon," he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the 
corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from 
which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the 
gagged terminals were situated. 

"Computer," he hissed again. 

"Mmmmm?" 

"When I ungag you..." 

"Mmmmm." 

"Remind me to punch myself in the mouth." 

"Mmmmm mmm?" 

"Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is it 
dangerous?" 

"Mmmmm." 

"It is?" 

"Mmmm." 

"You didn't just go 'mmmm' twice?" 

"Mmmm mmmm." 

"Hmmmm." 

He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding 
his way down it, which was true. 

He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he 
suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and 
he stopped dead. He hadn't been able to turn off the doors' courtesy 
voice circuits. 



This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it 
because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been 
designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter 
unobserved. 

He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some 
words which his other head was quite shocked to hear. 

He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that 
in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the 
Sensor Field which extended out into the corridor and told the door 
when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom 
it must make a cheery and pleasant remark. 

He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself 
towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to 
avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field. He 
held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed 
sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings 
on chest expanders in the ship's gym. 

He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point. 

He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly 
and as quietly as he could, "Door, if you can hear me, say so very, very 
quietly." 

Very, very quietly, the door murmured, "I can hear you." 

"Good. Now, in a moment. I'm going to ask you to open. When you 
open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?" 

"OK." 

"And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door 
very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your 
satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, 

OK?" 

"OK." 

"And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?" 

"I understand." 

"OK," said Zaphod, tensing himself, "open now." 

The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The 
door closed quietly behind him. 

"Is that the way you like it, Mr. Beeblebrox?" said the door out loud. 



"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots 
who swung round to stare at him at that point, "that I have an 
extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand." 

There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots 
regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There 
was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially 
to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known anything 
about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient past of the 
Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons 
plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle 
next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral 
part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and 
replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then 
resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate 
Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently 
fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) 
that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period 
of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at 
this moment. 

He stared at them in shock. 

It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white 
bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. 

From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they 
were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to 
kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear. 

They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had 
forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship. 
Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and 
worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very 
heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had been 
so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself. 

The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to 
suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, 
mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear 
this impression out. Before going on to what it actually said, it is 
worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the first living organic 
being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten 
billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history 



lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more 
impressed by this honour. 

The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It had 
almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was. 

It said, "You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand." 

Zaphod didn't know what it meant for a moment, but then he 
glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he 
had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought 
it was. 

"Yeah," he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, 
"well, I wouldn't want to overtax your imagination, robot." For a while 
nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were 
obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him. 

"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship," he said with 
a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, "through 
mine." 

There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper 
dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship 
precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply 
locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than 
two combs. 

Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the 
conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it 
in the form of questions. 

"... haven't you?" he added. 

"Yes," replied the robot." 

"Er, OK," said Zaphod. "So what are you cats doing here?" 

Silence. 

"Robots," said Zaphod, "what are you robots doing here?" 

"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail." 

Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. 
The robot seemed to understand this. 

"The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the robot, "to 
release our Masters from Krikkit." 

Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again. 



"The Key," continued the robot simply, "was disintegrated in time 
and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives 
your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall be 
released. The Universal Readjustment will continue." 

Zaphod nodded again. 

"What are you talking about?" he said. 

A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally 
expressionless face. He seemed to be finding the conversation 
depressing. 

"Obliteration," it said. "We seek the Key," it repeated, "we already 
have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex Pillar. In a 
moment we will have the Gold Bail..." 

"No you won't." 

"We will," stated the robot. 

"No you won't. It makes my ship work." 

"In a moment," repeated the robot patiently, "we will have the 
Gold Bail..." 

"You will not," said Zaphod. 

"And then we must go," said the robot, in all seriousness, "to a 
party." 

"Oh," said Zaphod, startled. "Can I come?" 

"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you." 

"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun. 

"Yes," said the robot, and they shot him. 

Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before 
he fell down. 



Chapter 10 


"Shhh," said Slartibartfast. "Listen and watch." 

Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The sky was dark and 
empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which 
pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They 
stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted arou nd 
them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion of the soil 
and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The soil seemed heavy 
and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the impression that 
this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects. 

The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to 
cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, 
landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what you're used to. 

He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was 
quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of 
the hill. He looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and 
waving, and moving slowly in their direction. 

As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the 
dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of 
people who were walking home across the hill towards the town. 

They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging 
lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and 
grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how 
terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they 
enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going 
home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the 
effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of 
year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so 
much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his 
feet up by the fire on evening, humming it to Linda and wondering 
what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex. 

"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones. 



Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about 
Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then the logic 
of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he 
discovered that he still didn't understand what the old man meant. 

"What?" he said. 

"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and if his 
breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like 
someone in Hades with bronchitis. 

Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little 
information he had at his disposal at this point. 

The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they 
seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, 
but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical 
perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long coach journey 
with them, but the point was that if they deviated in any way from 
being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice 
rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping lungwork from 
Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio 
commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators 
taking their work home with them? 

Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn't quite 
fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and 
what... 

Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if 
sensing what was going through his mind. 

"The game you know as cricket," he said, and his voice still seemed 
to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just one of those 
curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the 
mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of 
time. Of all the races on the Galaxy, only the English could possibly 
revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the 
Universe and transform it into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as 
an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game. 

"Rather fond of it myself," he added, "but in most people's eyes 
you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste. 
Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that's 
very nasty." 



"Um," said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his 
cognitive synapses were coping with this as best as they could, "um." 

"And these," said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural 
and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past 
them, "are the ones who started it all, and it will start tonight. Come, 
we will follow, and see why." 

They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the 
cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to 
tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they 
were simply walking through a recorded Informational Illusion, they 
could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the 
notice their quarry would have taken of them. 

Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now 
singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft 
night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted 
McCartney Kent and Essex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for 
Hampshire. 

"You must surely know," said Slartibartfast to Ford, "what it is that 
is about to happen?" 

"Me?" said Ford. "No." 

"Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a 
child?" 

"I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod," said Ford, "it was very 
distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning 
things." 

At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the 
party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have had 
McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over 
the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had 
some curious lyrics. The songwriter was referring to meeting with a 
girl not "under the moon" or "beneath the stars" but "above the 
grass", which struck Arthur a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at 
the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was 
an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave 
him a feeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so. 

"No," said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, "the 
people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves 'We are alone in 



the Universe.' They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud, you see, 
their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the 
utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy. Because of the Dust Cloud there 
has never been anything to see in the sky. At night it is totally blank. 
During the day there is the sun, but you can't look directly at that so 
they don't. They are hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind 
spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. 

"You see, the reason why they have never thought 'We are alone in 
the Universe' is that until tonight they don't know about the Universe. 
Until tonight." 

He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him. 

"Imagine," he said, "never even thinking 'We are alone' simply 
because it has never occurred to you to think that there's any other 
way to be." 

He moved on again. 

"I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving," he added. 

As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high 
up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in alarm, 
but for a moment or two could see nothing. 

Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them 
had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to 
do with it. They were glancing around themselves in consternation, 
left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground. It never occurred 
to them to look upwards. 

The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few 
moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came 
hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile 
from where they were standing was something that you had to be 
there to experience. 

Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the 
Starship Bistromath. 

Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a 
majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great 
shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds of 
years ago now, and with good reason. 



It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more 
pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history 
(see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the 
misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability 
Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was 
fully, or at all, understood. 

The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a 
prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to 
ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that anything would ever go 
wrong with any part of the ship. 

They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and 
circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was 
Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost 
immediately. 

The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay 
beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser-lit 
tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and 
needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness; but when 
launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio 
message - an SOS - before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total 
existence failure. 

However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one 
science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was 
conclusively proven that more people watched the tri-d coverage of 
the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been 
recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of 
audience research. 

Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova 
which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins is the 
star around which most of the Galaxy's major insurance underwriters 
live, or rather lived. 

But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to 
mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring, the GSS 
Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken of with awe, 
pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, 
in fact most of the better known emotions, the one which regularly 
commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first 



spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not because it was 
a wonderful ship. It wasn't. 

It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked 
up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had 
been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it 
was one well (it wasn't) but that it was done at all. The period of time 
which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit 
had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the 
launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year. 

Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that 
this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore 
completely safe. In real life it wasn't a ship he would have set foot in 
for all the rice wine in China. "Extremely rickety" was one phrase 
which sprang to mind, and "Please may I get out?" was another. 

"This is going to fly?" said Arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the lashed- 
together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior 
of the ship. 

Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly 
safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a 
little harrowing. 

Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed. 

"Why not," said Ford, "go mad?" 

In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence 
for the very good reason that they weren't actually there, were the 
three pilots. They had also constructed the ship. They had been on 
the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs. Their 
brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien 
spaceship. They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out 
of the wreckage of that burnt-up spaceship, all the while singing lilting 
spaceship-stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship and this 
was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little 
song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and 
ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow 
that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away 
from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them 
terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories 
of how nicely the puppy was growing up. 

Pow, they took off. 



They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was 
doing. 

"No way," said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the 
shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet's 
atmosphere, "no way," he repeated, "does anyone design and build a 
ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I don't believe it. 
Prove it to me and I still won't believe it." He shook his head 
thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it. 

The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast 
fastwound them through it. 

Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the 
hollow, spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and home 
planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out. 

It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and 
consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple 
past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy 
darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit. 

The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on 
Arthur's heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit 
pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge. They were now 
on the very boundary of the historical knowledge of their race. This 
was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, 
or even known that there was any speculation to be done. 

The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the 
silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if there was 
anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the 
wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange 
and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds 
of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit. 

History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. 

Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. 
It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. 
And suddenly it was gone. 

They flew out of the cloud. 

They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust 
and their minds sang with fear. 



For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the 
Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. 
And then they turned round. 

"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for 
home. 

On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective 
songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family 
life and the obliteration of all other life forms. 



Chapter 11 


"So you see," said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially 
constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces 
between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive 
perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the 
restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which 
allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, "how 
it is." 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford. 

"What do I do," said Arthur, "with this piece of chicken?" 

Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely. 

"Toy with it," he said, "toy with it." 

He demonstrated with his own piece. 

Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function 
thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four-dimensionally 
through what Slartibartfast had assured him was five-dimensional 
space. 

"Overnight," said Slartibartfast, "the whole population of Krikkit 
was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent..." 

"... if whimsical..." interpolated Arthur. 

"... ordinary people," said Slartibartfast, "into charming, delightful, 
intelligent..." 

"... whimsical..." 

"... manic xenophobes. The idea of a Universe didn't fit into their 
world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with it. And so, 
charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they 
decided to destroy it. What's the matter now?" 

"I don't like the wine very much," said Arthur sniffing it. 

"Well, send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it." 



Arthur did so. He didn't like the topography of the waiter's smile, 
but he'd never liked graphs anyway. 

"Where are we going?" said Ford. 

"Back to the Room of Informational Illusions," said Slartibartfast, 
rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of 
a paper napkin, "for the second half." 



Chapter 12 


"The people of Krikkit," said His High Judgmental Supremacy, 
Judiciary Pag, UVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed) 

Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, "are, 
well, you know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, 
who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way 
some mornings. Shit. 

"OK," he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of 
him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach 
Loafers, "so you wouldn't necessarily want to share a Galaxy with 
these guys." 

This was true. 

The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and 
thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of 
hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of 
major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next 
wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence. 

The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace 
and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a 
meadow. 

"I mean," continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra-modern 
(this was ten billion years ago, when "ultra-modern" meant lots of 
stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom, "these 
guys are just obsessed." 

This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet 
managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the 
people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose - the 
destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit. 

It is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden grasp of 
all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of 
spaceships, and their millions of lethal white robots. 



These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had 
encountered them - in most cases, however, the terror was 
extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror. They 
were savage, single-minded flying battle machines. They wielded 
formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished one way, 
would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired 
blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a third way, 
launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor 
incendiary devices to Maxi-Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which could 
take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the 
battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and launched them with 
phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to 
hundreds of thousands of miles. 

"OK," said Judiciary Pag again, "so we won." He paused and 
chewed a little gum. "We won," he repeated, "but that's no big deal. I 
mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long 
did it take us? Clerk of the Court?" 

"M'lud?" said the severe little man in black, rising. 

"How long, kiddo?" 

"It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in this matter. Time and 
distance..." 

"Relax, guy, be vague." 

"I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a..." 

"Bite the bullet and be it." 

The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that like most of 
the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or Zipo Bibrok 
5x108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather 
distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and a cad. He seemed to 
think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind 
ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and 
unfortunately he appeared to be right. 

"Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two thousand years," the 
Clerk murmured unhappily. 

"And how many guys zilched out?" 

"Two grillion, m'lud." The Clerk sat down. A hydrospectic photo of 
him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly. 



Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein 
were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire 
Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, 
depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of Zap-Proof 
Crystal stood a representative group of the people of Krikkit, looking 
with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment 
on them. This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and 
Judiciary Pag knew it. 

He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair. 

"That's a whole lotta stiffs," he said quietly. 

The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view. 

"So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you 
wouldn't want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just gonna 
keep at it, not if they're not gonna learn to relax a little. I mean it's 
just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't it, right? Pow, pow, pow, 
when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right 
out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you." 

He sat back and sipped reflectively. 

"OK," he said, "hear me, hear me. It's, like, these guys, you know, 
are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And according to their 
view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right. Sounds 
crazy, but I think you'll agree. They believe in..." 

He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of 
his Judicial jeans. 

"They believe in 'peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, 
and the obliteration of all other life forms'." 

He shrugged. 

"I've heard a lot worse," he said. 

He scratched his crotch reflectively. 

"Freeeow," he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up to 
the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round. 

"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said. 

"Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, 
rather nervously. 

"Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in 
it. I got an idea." 



He pushed away the glass and leaned forward. 

"Hear me, hear me," he said. 

The solution was brilliant, and went like this: 

The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an 
envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost 
infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the envelope so 
that it would remain invisible and impenetrable. Escape from the 
envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were locked from the 
outside. 

When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the 
whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the 
days before it was known that the end of the Universe would be a 
spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then 
the planet of Krikkit and its sun would emerge from its Slo-Time 
envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the 
twilight of the Universal void. 

The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the 
envelope. 

The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy - the Wikkit Gate. 

By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag 
was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of the 
jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier. 



Chapter 13 


Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5x108 had cut the bottoms off his 
Galactic State jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his 
judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence of 
Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of 
the jury. She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the Cloudworlds of 
Yaga. She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal 
bodies. 

"Did you hear the news?" she said. 

"Weeeeelaaaaah!" said Zipo Bibrok 5x108, and you would have had 
to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this was 
on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on hearsay. 

"No," he added, when the thing that had made him say 
"Weeeeelaaaaah" had stopped happening. He moved his body round 
slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval 
Vod's three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously 
beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest 
tanning power ever known. 

A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along 
the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next. 
On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted back to sea. 

"I hope it isn't good news," muttered Zipo Bibrok 5x108, '"cos I 
don't think I could bear it." 

"Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today," said the girl 
sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward thing 
sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was 
that sort of day. "I heard it on the radio," she said, "when I went back 
to the ship for the oil." 

"Uhuh," muttered Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled 
sand. 

"Something happened," she said. 

"Mmmm?" 



"Just after the Slo-Time envelope was locked/' she said, and 
paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, "a Krikkit 
warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to 
be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize the Key." 

Zipo sat up sharply. 

"Hey, what?" he said. 

"It's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big 
Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and the 
warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time 
continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever." 

She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her 
fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down. 

"Do what you did a moment or two ago," he murmured. 

"That?" she said. 

"No, no," he said, "that." 

She tried again. 

"That?" she asked. 

"Weeeeelaaaaah!" 

Again, you had to be there. 

The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again. 

A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him. 



Chapter 14 


"Nothing is lost for ever," said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly 
in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take 
away, "except for the Cathedral of Chalesm." 

"The what?" said Arthur with a start. 

"The Cathedral of Chalesm," repeated Slartibartfast. "It was during 
the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I..." 

"The what?" said Arthur again. 

The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped 
would be one last onslaught on his story. The robot waiter moved 
through the space-time matrices in a way which spectacularly 
combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the 
candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly 
about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they 
had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby 
successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a 
parking orbit round a strange planet. The waiter was now anxious to 
complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro. 

"All will become clear," said Slartibartfast. 

"When?" 

"In a minute. Listen. The time streams are now very polluted. 
There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and 
more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. 
Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see." 

"So I hear," said Arthur. 

"Look, where are we going?" said Ford, pushing his chair back from 
the table with impatience. "Because I'm eager to get there." 

"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, "to 
try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of 
the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo-Time 
envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters." 



"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party." 

"I did," said Slartibartfast, and hung his head. 

He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to 
exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford 
Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic 
story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink 
a lot and dance with girls. 

The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until 
he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford 
Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan Megaleach 
attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off 
with his spaceship. 

"When," said Ford eagerly, "do we get there?" 

"When I've finished telling you why we have to go there." 

"I know why I'm going," said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his 
hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made people 
twitch. 

Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. 

He had been planning to learn to play the octraventral 
heebiephone - a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the 
wrong number of mouths. 

He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly 
inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to 
set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important. 

Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time 
work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all 
seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself 
spending his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the 
Galaxy. 

He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily. 

"Listen," he said, "at Camtim..." 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I 
noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times 
plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces 
of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly - the Wooden Pillar, 
which appeared on your planet, and the Silver Bail. It seems to be at 



some sort of party. We must go there to retrieve it before the Krikkit 
robots find it, or who knows what may hap?" 

"No," said Ford firmly. "We must go to the party in order to drink a 
lot and dance with girls." 

"But haven't you understood everything I...?" 

"Yes," said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, "I've 
understood it all perfectly well. That's why I want to have as many 
drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still 
any left. If everything you've shown us is true..." 

"True? Of course it's true." 

"... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova." 

"A what?" said Arthur sharply again. Fie had been following the 
conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the 
thread now. 

"A whelk's chance in a supernova," repeated Ford without losing 
momentum. "The..." 

"What's a whelk got to do with a supernova?" said Arthur. 

"It doesn't," said Ford levelly, "stand a chance in one." 

Fie paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly 
puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him that it wasn't. 

"A supernova," said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could, "is a 
star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with 
the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super-heavy 
neutron star. It's a star which burns up other stars, got it? Nothing 
stands a chance in a supernova." 

"I see," said Arthur. 

"The..." 

"So why a whelk particularly?" 

"Why not a whelk? Doesn't matter." 

Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce 
momentum as best he could. 

"The point is," he said, "that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, 
and Arthur - particularly and especially Arthur - are just dilletantes, 
eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like." 

Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage. 
Fie started to speak. 



" - ..." is as far as he got. 

"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford. 

M n 

"And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. 
They care, we don't. They win." 

"I care about lots of things," said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling 
partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty. 

"Such as?" 

"Well," said the old man, "life, the Universe. Everything, really. 
Fjords." 

"Would you die for them?" 

"Fjords?" blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. "No." 

"Well then." 

"Wouldn't see the point, to be honest." 

"And I still can't see the connection," said Arthur, "with whelks." 

Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and 
refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point. 

"The point is," he hissed, "that we are not obsessive people, and 
we don't stand a chance against..." 

"Except for your sudden obsession with whelks," pursued Arthur, 
"which I still haven't understood." 

"Will you please leave whelks out of it?" 

"I will if you will," said Arthur. "You brought the subject up." 

"It was an error," said Ford, "forget them. The point is this." 

Fie leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers. 

"What was I talking about?" he said wearily. 

"Let's just go down to the party," said Slartibartfast, "for whatever 
reason." Fie stood up, shaking his head. 

"I think that's what I was trying to say," said Ford. 

For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the 
bathroom. 



Chapter 15 


Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is being 
polluted. 

The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and 
practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone 
who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced 
hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time 
travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how 
the idea was arrived at in the first place. One rationalization of this 
problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered 
simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. 

The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well. 

Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to 
some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly significant in that 
it was the single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to 
be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round 
you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly 
vexed question). 

There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what 
are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest poems 
in existence, the Songs of the Long Land. 

They are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't 
speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with 
emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness and oneness of things that 
you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly 
pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and 
soda. They were that good. 

Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. He lived 
there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made 
of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting 
fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought 
about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he 



thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had left him and 
precisely what he thought about that. 

Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. 
News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they 
illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might 
otherwise have been darker and drier. 

Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major 
correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might 
have been better still if he had had access to some high-quality 
correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few 
words on that effect. 

They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the 
situation - with some difficulty - to him, and did indeed persuade him. 
In fact they persuaded him to such an effect that he became 
extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was 
otherwise destined to write which such precision never got around to 
leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice 
pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat 
shows, on which he sparkled wittily. 

He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a 
problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting 
fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a 
later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy 
them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on 
the way. 

Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. 
Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so 
what's changed? The first people say that that isn't the point. They 
aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure that that 
isn't it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try to stop this sort 
of thing going on. Their case was considerably strengthened by the 
fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that 
not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in 
order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the 
refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the 
past in order to allow ion production to start on time, that the 
Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place. 



Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely 
valuable. 

So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real 
Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between 
one country and another, and between one world and another, so 
time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and 
another. "The past," they say, "is now truly like a foreign country. 
They do things exactly the same there." 



Chapter 16 


Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering 
about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still 
indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and 
painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get 
used to. 

He looked around for the others. 

They weren't there. 

He looked around for the others again. 

They still weren't there. 

He closed his eyes. 

He opened them 

He looked around for the others. 

They obstinately persisted in their absence. 

He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely 
futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his 
eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had 
been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across 
his face. 

So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed 
put. 

If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip. If this was a 
party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that everybody else had 
left. He abandoned this line of thought as futile. Obviously this wasn't 
a party. It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel of something - there 
was insufficient light to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. 
The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which 
sounded worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to 
the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding 
corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and 



eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to 
say... "Yes?" 

This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved 
him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him 
it was a hollow dirge and he stopped. 

His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that 
Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half-expected suddenly to see 
lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him. He 
caught his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He didn't know what 
he did expect. 

Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for 
at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie 
green neon sign. 

It said, silently: 

YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED 

The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all 
certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish. 
Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick 
of his imagination. A neon sign is either on or off, depending on 
whether it has electricity running through it or not. There was no way, 
he told himself, that it could possibly effect the transition from one 
state to the other with a contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself 
tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless. 

The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with 
just three dots and a comma. Like this: 

• • v 

Only in green neon. 

It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a 
second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the 
sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman pedantry, 
he reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry. 

The sentence then completed itself with these two words: 

ARTHUR DENT. 

He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it. It 
still said ARTHUR DENT, so he reeled again. 



Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the 
darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his 
retina. 

WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said. 

After a moment, it added: 

I DON'T THINK. 

The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this 
time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now 
come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped into a 
kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, 
but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He peered 
huntedly into the darkness. 

"Er, hello?" he said. 

He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the 
"er". At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if 
somebody started to beat on a bass drum. 

He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his 
heart beating. 

He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn't his 
heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass 
drum. 

Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt 
off. He put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch, which 
wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again. It said: 

DO NOT BEALARMED. 

After a pause, it added: 

BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT. 

Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes 
seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain if this was 
because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted 
to leave at this point. 

"Hello?" he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and 
aggressive self-assertion into it. "Is anyone there?" 

There was no reply, nothing. 

This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have 
done, and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And 



the more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while 
he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had 
seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some 
imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from 
behind. 

Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly. 

There was nothing there. 

Just blackness. 

This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, 
back the way he had come. 

After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that 
he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing 
away from in the first place. 

This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do. He 
decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been 
backing, and turned around again. 

It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the 
correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster 
standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to 
jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to 
work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of. 

"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again," said the monster, 
which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to 
make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could tell 
that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he 
was able to sleep at nights. It was... it was... it was... 

Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little familiar. 

A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was 
looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly. 

He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high 
hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he had 
heard. 

It was a terribly realistic hologram. 

It vanished. 

"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, 
and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like 



molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, "as the 
rabbit." 

With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth 
with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and lovable rabbit - an 
image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair 
seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat. 
Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable 
unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes. 

"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in darkness. One 
morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world 
and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive 
instrument made of flint. 

"Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard as I 
recall. 

"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I 
happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again 
and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted me with the 
bag you'd made of my previous skin. 

"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you 
are also staggeringly tactless." 

The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped. 

"I see you have lost the bag," said the voice. "Probably got bored 
with it, did you?" 

Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he had 
been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and 
had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every 
time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with 
the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as they stood there 
he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at 
the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard 
skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few moments ago before he 
arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn't one he would have 
chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn't his, 
and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he 
was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or 
rather its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous 
owner, viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of 
attempting vainly to address. 



All he actually managed to say was "Erp". 

"Meet the newt you trod on," said the voice. 

And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green 
scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself 
standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped again, but could find 
nowhere to leap to. 

"That was me, too," continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, 
"as if you didn't know..." 

"Know?" said Arthur with a start. "Know?" 

"The interesting thing about reincarnation," rasped the voice, "is 
that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to 
them." 

He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was 
already quite enough effect going on. 

"I was aware," hissed the voice, "that is, I became aware. Slowly. 
Gradually." 

He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath. 

"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed, "when the same thing 
kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I 
got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any time, I'm just 
getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent - pow, he kills me. 

"Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer. Bit of 
a bloody giveaway! 

"'That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way 
back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended venture 
into the land of the living, 'that man who just ran over me as I was 
hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little 
familiar...' And gradually I got to piece it together. Dent, you multiple- 
me-murderer!" 

The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur 
stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief. 

"Here's the moment. Dent," shrieked the voice, now reaching a 
feverish pitch of hatred, "here's the moment when at last I knew!" 

It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in 
front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here's an 
attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It was a huge 
palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature 



rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones. High 
above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the 
dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which... 

Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own 
mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster 
that was being tipped helplessly into it. 

He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes. 

When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The 
corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his thoughts. 
They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had 
a chaperone. 

The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large 
section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark 
blackness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a 
mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel. 

And the voice spoke to him again. 

"Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent," it said. "I dare you to tell me it 
was a coincidence!" 

"It was a coincidence," said Arthur quickly. 

"It was not!" came the answering bellow. 

"It was," said Arthur, "it was..." 

"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared the voice, "is not 
Agrajag!!!" 

"And presumably," said Arthur, "you would claim that that was 
your name." 

"Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft 
syllogism. 

"Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence," said Arthur. 

"Come in here and say that!" howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy 
again. 

Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he 
nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing 
towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and 
revealed what it was he had walked into. 


It was a Cathedral of Hate. 



It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but 
actually sprained. 

It was huge. It was horrific. 

It had a Statue in it. 

We will come to the Statue in a moment. 

The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been 
carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was 
that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It seemed to 
Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it. 

It was black. 

Where it wasn't black you were inclined to wish that it was, 
because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were 
picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying 
colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, 
Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the 
way. 

The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were 
gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. 

The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, 
from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, 
to which we will come in a moment. 

And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch, 
then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would have 
put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it, which they weren't, 
and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn't. 

Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in 
memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent. 

The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and 
had asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which 
had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat 
a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of 
a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided he didn't like 
and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets 
of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration, just to make 
the point. 

And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, 
to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication 



that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, 
over and over again. 

And it was equally clear that this person was, however u nfairly, 
extremely upset and annoyed. 

In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of 
annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe. It 
was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing flame of 
annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and 
space in its infinite umbrage. 

And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the 
Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of 
Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, 
there was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed with insult to its 
subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to 
make any subject feel bad. From the small pimple on the side of his 
nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of 
Arthur Dent which wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor. 

Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, 
bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man 
Universe. 

With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic 
fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, 
swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or 
doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn't quite identify. 

His many feet were mostly stamping on ants. 

Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it 
slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of 
things. 

And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the 
figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had 
supposedly been persecuting all this time. 

"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag. 

Fie, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. Fie waddled slowly 
around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws. 


"Look...!" protested Arthur. 



"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHHM!" explained Agrajag, and Arthur 
reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather 
frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition. 

Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery. 

His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the 
pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been 
strong, muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was 
probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the 
physical odds. 

He had the most astounding collection of teeth. 

They looked as if they each came from a completely different 
animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre 
angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he'd 
lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as 
well. 

Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as 
sane as a fish in a privet bush. 

"I was at a cricket match," he rasped. 

This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that 
Arthur practically choked. 

"Not in this body," screeched the creature, "not in this body! This is 
my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill-Arthur- 
Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it, too." 

"But..." 

"I was at," roared Agrajag, "a cricket match! I had a weak heart 
condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket 
match? As I'm watching, what happens? 

"Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of 
me. The last thing I can't help but notice before my poor heart gives 
out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone 
in his beard. Coincidence?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"Coincidence?" screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its 
broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a 
particularly nasty tooth. On closer examination, such as he'd been 
hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face was 
covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters. 



He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was 
appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He 
pulled it out and threw it away. 

"Look," he said, "it's just fate playing silly buggers with you. With 
me. With us. It's a complete coincidence." 

"What have you got against me. Dent?" snarled the creature, 
advancing on him in a painful waddle. 

"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing." 

Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. 

"Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing 
against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social 
interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!" 

"But look," said Arthur, "I'm very sorry. There's been a terrible 
misunderstanding. I've got to go. Have you got a clock? I'm meant to 
be helping save the Universe." He backed away still further. 

Agrajag advanced still further. 

"At one point," he hissed, "at one point, I decided to give up. Yes, I 
would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And what 
happened?" 

Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no 
idea and didn't want to have one either. He found he had backed up 
against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what 
Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers. 

He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering 
above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was 
meant to be doing. 

"I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world," pursued 
Agrajag, "as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a bowl. This 
particularly happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, 
unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly 
grim planet. Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, 
you might think. And you'd be right. That life ended a very short while 
later, three hundred miles lower. In, I might add, the fresh wreckage 
of a whale. My spirit brother." 

He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred. 



"On the way down," he snarled, "I couldn't help noticing a flashy- 
looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this flashy- 
looking spaceship was a smug-looking Arthur Dent. Coincidence?!!" 

"Yes!" yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the 
arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into 
existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which 
leapt easily to the eye. 

"I must go," insisted Arthur. 

"You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you." 

"No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb 
up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have to save 
the Universe, you see. I have to find a Silver Bail, that's the point. 
Tricky thing to do dead." 

"Save the Universe!" spat Agrajag with contempt. "You should have 
thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What 
about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone..." 

"I've never been there," said Arthur. 

"... tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think the 
bullet hit? What did you say?" 

"Never been there," repeated Arthur. "What are you talking about? 
I have to go." 

Agrajag stopped in his tracks. 

"You must have been there. You were responsible for my death 
there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!" He quivered. 

"I've never heard of the place," insisted Arthur. "I've certainly never 
had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I go there 
later, do you think?" 

Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror. 

"You haven't been to Stavromula Beta... yet?" he whispered. 

"No," said Arthur, "I don't know anything about the place. Certainly 
never been to it, and don't have any plans to go." 

"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, 
"you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly about 
him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought you here too soon!" 

He started to scream and bellow. "I've brought you here too 
zarking soon!" 



Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur. 

"I'm going to kill you anyway!" he roared. "Even if it's a logical 
impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to blow this whole 
mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out of this one, Dent!" 

He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a 
small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that he was 
really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down from his vantage 
place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the 
three-quarters-crazed creature. 

He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing 
down on top of the altar. 

Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and 
turned a wild eye on Arthur. 

"You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully. "You've only 
gone and killed me again. I mean, what do you want from me, 
blood?" 

He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, 
smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so. 

Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to 
have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly 
shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency. He stared 
wildly around him. 

The only exit appeared to be the way he came in. He pelted 
towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he did so. 

He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, 
he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens, 
flashing lights. 

Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him. 

It wasn't flashing. It was daylight. 



Chapter 17 


Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is 
Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this 
reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply to our 
Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of the higher 
dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves, and 
have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra-Cricket for 
whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is. 

"Let's be blunt, it's a nasty game" (says The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy) "but then anyone who has been to any of the higher 
dimensions will know that they're a pretty nasty heathen lot up there 
who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if 
anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right-angles to 
reality." 

This is another example of the fact that The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the 
street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to walk in off the 
street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are 
there. 

There is a fundamental point here. 

The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of 
idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously 
long lunch-breaks. 

The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its 
financial records, lost in the mists of time. 

For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, 
see below. 

Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor 
called Hurling Frootmig. 

Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its 
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust. 



There followed many years of penury and heart - searching during 
which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of 
mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with weights, and 
then, after a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of 
Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man's 
temporal day, and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy 
for his spiritual life, so Lunch should 

(a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and 

(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid 
down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where 
you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its first major 
commercial success. 

He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial 
lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the 
Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual work got done 
by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty 
offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing. 

Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo 
Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a 
very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, 
to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the 
efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored 
lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison. 

In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely left 
his office late one morning and has never since returned. Though well 
over a century has now passed, many members of the Guide staff still 
retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham 
croissant, and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon's work. 

Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been 
designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved the way he 
left it, with the addition of a small sign which says "LIG LURY JR, 
EDITOR, MISSING, PRESUMED FED". 

Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that 
Lig actually perished in the Guide's first extraordinary experiments in 
alternative book-keeping. Very little is known of this, and less still said. 
Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but 
utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the 
Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly 



afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster, is liable to 
get sued to smithereens. 

It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or 
three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for 
a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of 
UFO sightings there, not only above Lords Cricket Ground in St. John's 
Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in Somerset. 

Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, 
witchcraft, ley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected as the 
site for the new Hitchhiker's Guide financial records office, and indeed, 
ten years' worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill 
just outside the city mere hours before the Vogons arrived. 

None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange 
or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket, as 
played in the higher dimensions. A full set of rules is so massively 
complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a 
single volume, they underwent gravitational collapse and became a 
Black Hole. 

A brief summary, however, is as follows: 

Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them, but 
it keeps the crowds amused. 

Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone him 
off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection 
and training. 

Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field 
and build a high wall round them. 

The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator 
sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually 
being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's a lot 
more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has just watched a rather 
humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that 
believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history. 

Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over 
the wall for the players. Anything will do - cricket bats, basecube bats, 
tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with. 

Rule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all they 
are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player scores 



a "hit" on another player, he should immediately run away and 
apologize from a safe distance. 

Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and 
points, delivered through a megaphone. 

Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins. 

Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in 
the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the 
competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each 
other over the interpretation of these rules. This is all for the best, 
because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically 
damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket. 



Chapter 18 


As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side of the 
mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very, 
very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight 
blurred movement, and a lick of heat in the distance behind and 
above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began to slide, and he 
suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide" in a way which had 
never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to 
him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a 
strange and sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on 
it. He felt ill with fear and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain 
slurred, he slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The 
avalance began. 

Stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like 
clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and 
heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. 
His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground. 
He ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness, his heart 
pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him. 

The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if 
the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent 
persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge 
itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this 
time. He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and 
grabbing hold of his hair. 

And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his 
considerable momentum. But just at the moment that he was about 
to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of 
him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the 
baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his 
personal time-scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the 
ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing. 



What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around him 
in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was 
doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him 
was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders 
hurtling through the air around him. 

He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non¬ 
effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were 
hurtling through the air beneath him. 

He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him and the 
shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that 
is if you discounted the boulders which didn't stay in it for long, but 
bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity; the same 
law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical. 

It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness 
that self-preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn't try to think 
about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance 
sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought 
he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost. 

So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He thought 
about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought 
about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered 
what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, 
on the Earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a 
windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored with this train of 
thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was 
drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was 
trying so hard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport 
for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes - 
at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now 
floating about two hundred yards above the ground. 

He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to 
it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and 
tried to look at the situation steadily. 

He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back 
down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best just to 
give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of 
things he couldn't help noticing. One was that the eruption of the 
mountain seemed now to have spent itself - there was a crater just a 



little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in 
on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself, and the 
sadly abused figure of Agrajag. 

The other was his hold-all, the one he had lost at Athens airport. It 
was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by 
exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them. Why this 
should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was 
completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag's 
being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt 
strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there. And the nasty, 
fake leopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to 
the good, if not entirely to the explicable. 

He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the 
thing up. Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the 
surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn't even 
remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece 
of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from the 
pulverized remains of his home. 

Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which 
he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek 
olive oil still surviving in the Universe. 

Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, 
swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling 
its way towards the ground. 

It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let 
him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet 
above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decision. He bobbed 
there lightly. He frowned, but again, as lightly as he could. 

If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn't the extra weight 
just pull him straight to the ground? 

Mightn't the mere act of touching something on the ground 
suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding 
him in the air? 

Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this point and 
stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? 

If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? 



The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so 
quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, 
perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little 
again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement 
of it. He bobbed, he floated. He tried a little swoop. 

The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, 
his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down 
out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the 
ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the 
swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there. 

It was wonderful. 

And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He would 
swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing. He 
would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was 
certain that he could hold it. 

He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and 
better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all 
combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn't 
felt since, since - well as far as he could work out, since he was born. 
He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which 
was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a wasted ravaged look. He 
decided not to look at it any more. He would just pick up the bag and 
then... he didn't know what he was going to do after he had picked up 
the bag. He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where 
things went from there. 

He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and 
turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his body 
was willoming at this point. 

He ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived. 

The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground 
wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up 
to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards 
him. 

Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he 
could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very 
nearly wasn't, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the 
ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and 



began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a sudden collapsed, 
bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground. 

He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, 
swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment. 

His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way 
they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of 
potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had all 
the lightness of a bag of lead. 

He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness. He tried 
hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He tripped 
and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in the bag 
he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil but a duty¬ 
free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that 
realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now 
flying again. 

He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical 
delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the 
air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents 
of the hold-all. He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during 
its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by 
philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag 
did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of 
cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some creased 
postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting 
stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he 
was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason 
why was a sad one. He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, 
and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind. 

Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and 
extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back. 



Chapter 19 


The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its 
fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving. 
Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago, 
and there has been no follow-up. 

The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if 
you don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't go and 
look, because you won't enjoy it. 

There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, 
and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the 
fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering 
over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything you 
hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one. 

One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get 
worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the 
grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldn't 
leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective 
breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people 
now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or 
gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both. 

Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding 
generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one. 

So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is going 
to run out. 

Now, because of certain things which have happened which 
seemed like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a 
party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a 
good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point 
seems still to be a long way off. 

One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was 
that the party should fly - not in the normal sense that parties are 
meant to fly, but literally. 



One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the first 
generation clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, 
banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose the following 
morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of 
happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and 
uncertain bird over the treetops. 

Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself 
rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty 
arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had 
might on their side. 

The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding 
party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and 
swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point 
because of the enormous number of times that the band had already 
played all the numbers it knew over the years. 

They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for ransom for 
fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine 
and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers. 

The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, 
going to have to be faced one day. 

The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it 
was when they first started floating over it. 

It is in bad shape. 

The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one 
has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and 
unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky. 

It is one hell of a party. 

It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back. 



Chapter 20 


Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and 
dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud 
and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere 
indistinctly behind him. 

There was a sound he couldn't immediately identify, partly because 
he didn't know the tune "I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta" and partly 
because the band playing it were very tired, and some members of it 
were playing it in three-four time, some in four-four, and some in a 
kind of pie-eyed r2, each according to the amount of sleep he'd 
managed to grab recently. 

He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of 
himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, 
he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this 
was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed to have 
sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting, but he soon satisfied 
himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, 
as who wouldn't be? He couldn't understand what a building would 
be doing flying through the clouds. 

On the other hand, he would have been a little hard-pressed to 
come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he 
decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept 
each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall of pale but 
stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building proper. He 
seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which 
extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around. It 
was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its 
foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself 
bound together at the bottom end. 

Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, 
he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against the 
wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming freestyle, but 
someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly. 



Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could 
now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. 
He was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move 
an inch closer to the edge. 

Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a 
doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great 
reassurance to him. 

He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope 
that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of 
entrances than this one, which offered none. 

The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with 
fear, and after a short while he took the towel from out of his hold-all 
and did something with it which once again justified its supreme 
position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch¬ 
hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head so he wouldn't have to 
see what he was doing. 

His feet edged along the ground. His outstretched hand edged 
along the wall. 

Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner 
it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly 
fell straight off. It was another hand. 

The two hands gripped each other. 

He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back 
from his eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the 
retsina and the postcards from Santorini, and he very much didn't 
want to put it down. 

He experienced one of those "self" moments, one of those 
moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and 
think "Who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing 
well?" He whimpered very slightly. 

He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The other hand was 
holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onwards towards 
the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to 
dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some 
unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand. 

The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes 
peering into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, 



and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed 
door. 

They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror 
as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to 
resist the lurching and swaying of the building. 

"Where the zarking photon have you been?" hissed Ford, panic 
stricken. 

"Er, well," stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up 
that briefly. "Here and there. What are you doing here?" 

Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again. 

"They won't let us in without a bottle," he hissed. 



Chapter 21 


The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the 
party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of 
colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke, 
the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and avocado droppings, and 
the small group of pterodactyl-like creatures in lurex who descended 
on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, "A new pleasure, a new 
pleasure", was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God. 

"Didn't I see you at Milliways?" he was saying. 

"Were you the one with the hammer?" 

"Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more 
fraught." 

Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer 
dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of 
happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could 
hear at each other and occasionally having crises. 

"Seems fun," said Trillian. "What did you say, Arthur?" 

"I said, how the hell did you get here?" 

"I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe. Have 
you met Thor? He makes thunder." 

"Hello," said Arthur. "I expect that must be very interesting." 

"Hi," said Thor. "It is. Have you got a drink?" 

"Er, no actually..." 

"Then why don't you go and get one?" 

"See you later, Arthur," said Trillian. 

Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly. 

"Zaphod isn't here, is he?" he said. 

"See you," said Trillian firmly, "later." 



Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled, 
what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly 
to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet. 

He took Trillian's elbow in his extremely large hand and the 
muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of 
Volkswagens parking. 

He led her away. 

"One of the interesting things about being immortal," he said, 
"is..." 

"One of the interesting things about space," Arthur heard 
Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked 
like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at 
the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, "is how dull it is." 

"Dull?" said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and 
bloodshot eyes. 

"Yes," said Slartibartfast, "staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so. You 
see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to 
quote some statistics?" 

"Er, well..." 

"Please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally dull." 

"I'll come back and hear them in a moment," she said, patting him 
on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into 
the heaving crown. 

"I thought she'd never go," growled the old man. "Come, 
Earthman..." 

"Arthur." 

"We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere." 

"Can't we just relax a little?" Arthur said. "I've had a tough day. 
Trillian's here, incidentally, she didn't say how, it probably doesn't 
matter." 

"Think of the danger to the Universe..." 

"The Universe," said Arthur, "is big enough and old enough to look 
after itself for half an hour. All right," he added, in response to 
Slartibartfast's increasing agitation, "I'll wander round and see if 
anybody's seen it." 



"Good, good," said Slartibartfast, "good. " He plunged into the 
crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed. 

"Have you seen a bail anywhere?" said Arthur to a little man who 
seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody. "It's 
made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the Universe, 
and about this long." 

"No," said the enthusiastically wizened little man, "but do have a 
drink and tell me all about it." 

Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely 
unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing 
Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling a futile conversation 
at her above the din. 

"I like that hat!" he bawled. 

"What?" 

"I said, I like the hat." 

"I'm not wearing a hat." 

"Well, I like the head, then." 

"What?" 

"I said, I like the head. Interesting bone-structure." 

"What?" 

Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements 
he was performing. 

"I said, you dance great," he shouted, "just don't nod so much." 

"What?" 

"It's just that every time you nod," said Ford,"... owl" he added as 
his partner nodded forward to say "What?" and once again pecked 
him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept-forward 
skull. 

"My planet was blown up one morning," said Arthur, who had 
found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, 
at least, edited highlights of it, "that's why I'm dressed like this, in my 
dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you 
see. I didn't realize I'd be coming to a party." 

The little man nodded enthusiastically. 

"Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing gown. 
Rather than the space suit one would normally expect. Shortly after 



that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch 
of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was then shot at for a 
while and blown up. In fact I have been blown up ridiculously often, 
shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently 
I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave." 

"Ah," effervesced the little man, "and did you have a wonderful 
time?" 

Arthur started to choke violently on his drink. 

"What a wonderful exciting cough," said the little man, quite 
startled by it, "do you mind if I join you?" 

And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and 
spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by surprise 
that he started to choke violently, discovered he was already doing it 
and got thoroughly confused. 

Together they performed a lung-busting duet which went on for 
fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a 
halt. 

"So invigorating," said the little man, panting and wiping tears from 
his eyes. "What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you very much." 

He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd. 
Arthur shook his head in astonishment. 

A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking 
type with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little 
cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to 
what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to 
make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he 
tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold 
things hanging round his neck. He carried something in a black bag, 
and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn't want them to 
notice it. 

"Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?" he said. 

This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the 
enthusiastic little man. 

"Yes, it's Arthur Dent." 

The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than 
any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out. 



"Yeah," he said, "only there was a man in a mountain wanted to 
see you." 

"I met him." 

"Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know." 

"Yes, I met him." 

"Yeah, well I think you should know that." 

"I do. I met him." 

The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on 
the back. 

"OK," he said, "all right. I'm just telling you, right? Good night, good 
luck, win awards." 

"What?" said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at 
this point. 

"Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well." He made a sort of clucking 
noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic 
gesture. 

"Why?" said Arthur. 

"Do it badly," said the man, "who cares? Who gives a shit?" The 
blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he 
started to shout. 

"Why not go mad?" he said. "Go away, get off my back will you, 
guy. Just zark off!!!" 

"OK, I'm going," said Arthur hurriedly. 

"It's been real." The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off 
into the throng. 

"What was that about?" said Arthur to a girl he found standing 
beside him. "Why did he tell me to win awards?" 

"Just showbiz talk," shrugged the girl. "He's just won an award at 
the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards 
Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you 
didn't mention it, so he couldn't." 

"Oh," said Arthur, "oh, well I'm sorry I didn't. What was it for?" 

"The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word 'Fuck' In A Serious 
Screenplay. It's very prestigious." 

"I see," said Arthur, "yes, and what do you get for that?" 



"A Rory. It's just a small silver thing set on a large black base. What 
did you say?" 

"I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what the silver..." 
"Oh, I thought you said 'wop'." 

"Said what?" 

"Wop." 



Chapter 22 


People had been dropping in on the party now for some years, 
fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had 
occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world 
beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and 
blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit 
crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost 
imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been. Some of 
them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for 
long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it 
off to some other people's worlds where the air might be fresher and 
give them fewer headaches. 

The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out 
a feeble existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface 
would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the 
party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in 
haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear 
that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, 
that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be time to 
gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what 
time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of 
this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere. 

The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white 
spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it. Together they 
were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky in 
grotesque disregard of their own weight. 

The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way. 

The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little 
like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the 
second duck, whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that 
it doesn't feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it 
would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first 



duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy 
flying. 

The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the 
ground with shock waves. 

And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone. 

The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning 
against an unexpectedly open door. It span and wobbled on its hover 
jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead. It staggered back 
across the sky again. 

For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not 
continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded party. All 
the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken-backed pirouette 
could not disguise. 

The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the heavier 
was going to be the crash when finally it hit it. 

Inside, things were not going well either. They were going 
monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so 
loudly. The Krikkit robots had been. 

They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The 
Word 'Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene 
of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner-up 
for a Rory. 

"We would love to stay and help," shouted Ford, picking his way 
over the mangled debris, "only we're not going to." 

The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from 
amongst the smoking wreckage. 

"We have to go and save the Universe, you see," said Ford. "And if 
that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right. Either 
way, we're off." 

Fie suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously 
unbroken, on the ground. 

"Do you mind if we take this?" he said. "You won't be needing it." 

Fie took a packet of potato crisps too. 

"Trillian?" shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In the 
smoking mess he could see nothing. 



"Earthman, we must go," said Slartibartfast nervously. 

"Trillian?" shouted Arthur again. 

A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view, 
supported by her new friend the Thunder God. 

"The girl stays with me," said Thor. "There's a great party going on 
in Valhalla, we'll be flying off..." 

"Where were you when all this was going on?" said Arthur. 

"Upstairs," said Thor, "I was weighing her. Flying's a tricky business 
you see, you have to calculate wind..." 

"She comes with us," said Arthur. 

"Hey," said Trillian, "don't I..." 

"No," said Arthur, "you come with us." 

Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making 
some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean. 

"She comes with me," he said quietly. 

"Come on, Earthman," said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at 
Arthur's sleeve. 

"Come on, Slartibartfast," said Ford, picking at the old man's sleeve. 
Slartibartfast had the teleport device. 

The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except 
for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder 
God's black eyes. 

Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny little 
fists. 

"Want to make something of it?" he said. 

"I beg your minuscule pardon?" roared Thor. 

"I said," repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out 
of his voice, "do you want to make something of it?" He waggled his 
fists ridiculously. 

Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke 
curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in it too. 

He gripped his belt. 

He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the 
sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with 
you. 



He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up in 
his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up any 
possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a 
telegraph pole around with him. 

"Do I want," he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel 
mill, "to make something of it?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong 
and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it. 

"You want to step outside?" he snarled at Thor. 

"All right!" bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an 
enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive), and did 
so. 

"Good," said Arthur, "that's got rid of him. Slarty, get us out of 
here." 



Chapter 23 


"All right," shouted Ford at Arthur, "so I'm a coward, the point is 
I'm still alive." They were back aboard the Starship Bistromath, so was 
Slartibartfast, so was Trillian. Harmony and concord were not. 

"Well, so am I alive, aren't I?" retaliated Arthur, haggard with 
adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if 
they wanted to punch each other. 

"You damn nearly weren't," exploded Ford. 

Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot 
couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a 
bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldn't fathom. He 
appealed to him. 

"Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?" he 
said, quivering with emotion. 

"I don't know," replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly. "I'm not 
sure," he added, glancing up very briefly, "that I do." He stared at his 
instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement. "You'll have to 
explain it to us again," he said. 

"Well..." 

"But later. Terrible things are afoot." 

He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom. 

"We fared rather pathetically at the party. I'm afraid," he said, "and 
our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key 
in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don't know," he muttered. 
"Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the idea at all. 
Probably end up dead." 

"Where is Trillian anyway?" said Arthur with a sudden affectation 
of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had 
berated him for wasting time over all the business with the Thunder 
God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape. 
Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever anybody 



might have felt it was worth, was that he had been extraordinarily 
brave and resourceful. 

The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a 
pair of fetid dingo's kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that 
Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other and had 
wandered off somewhere. 

"And where are my potato crisps?" said Ford. 

"They are both," said Slartibartfast, without looking up, "in the 
Room of Informational Illusions. I think that your young lady friend is 
trying to understand some problems of Galactic history. I think the 
potato crisps are probably helping her." 



Chapter 24 


It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with 
potatoes. 

For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people 
called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax. That was just the name of 
their race. The name of their army was something quite horrific. 

Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic history than anything 
we have so far encountered - twenty billion years ago - when the 
Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea worth fighting for was a 
new one. 

And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were 
good at, and being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their 
enemies (i.e. everybody else), they fought each other. Their planet 
was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with abandoned cities 
which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in 
turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends 
lived and squabbled with each other. 

The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was just to 
be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an 
Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, 
one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy. 

The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him 
into a room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat 
himself up. 

Eventually they realized that this was something they were going 
to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who 
had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, 
security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had to spend at least 
forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to 
work off his or her surplus aggressions. 



For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would 
be much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot the 
potatoes instead. 

This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, 
and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war 
for weeks. 

Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is that 
they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer. 

It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this 
day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It was the 
first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it 
carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think 
more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked. 

The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of their 
regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not 
enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of 
trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the 
Fire Mountains of Frazfraga, neither of which terrains they felt at 
home in. 

So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray 
and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax 
and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that enough was 
enough, and they ordered Flactar to design for them an Ultimate 
Weapon. 

"What do you mean," asked Flactar, "by Ultimate?" 

To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, "Read a bloody 
dictionary," and plunged back into the fray. 

So Flactar designed an Ultimate Weapon. 

It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in 
hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every 
major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and 
thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial 
supernova. 

When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a 
Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, 
they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so. 

Flactar had been shocked by the whole idea. 



He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate 
Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable 
consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the 
known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the 
liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he 
hoped that everyone involved would, on sober reflection, feel that... 

The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer. 

Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as 
well. 

Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous 
Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they 
went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which 
was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the 
Garfighters, the Stilettans and the potatoes. 

Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit. She 
emerged from the Room of informational Illusions thoughtfully, just 
in time to discover that they had arrived too late. 



Chapter 25 


Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on 
the top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued a 
lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of 
Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses 
to an unstoppable historic event. 

They didn't realize they were going to see two. 

They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched 
the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the 
void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of 
them. 

They stared into the blinding event. 

An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there, by 
once again exploiting the mind's predisposition to have tricks played 
on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of 
not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else's. 

The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags 
of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in 
shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks 
danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round 
them. 

The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit 
Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights. 

The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered: 
the Steel Pillar (or Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the Gold Bail 
(or Heart of the Improbability Drive) of Prosperity, the Perspex Pillar 
(or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and Reason, the Silver 
Bail (or Rory Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word "Fuck" 

In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or 
Ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket) of 
Nature and Spirituality. 



"I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?" asked Arthur 
nervously. 

"No," sighed Slartibartfast. 

The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face was 
a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, 
he allowed it to collapse into one of relief. 

"Pity," he said. 

"We have no weapons," said Slartibartfast, "stupidly." 

"Damn," said Arthur very quietly. 

Ford said nothing. 

Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way. 
She was staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid. 

The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time 
envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of 
Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots. 

The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the 
Krikkit robots were aware of their presence. They could only assume 
that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in the 
circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an historic 
task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt. 

"Terrible impotent feeling, isn't it?" said Arthur, but the others 
ignored him. 

In the centre of the area of light which the robots were 
approaching, a square-shaped crack appeared in the ground. The 
crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became 
clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly 
rising. 

At the same time they became aware of some other movement, 
but it was almost sublimal, and for a moment or two it was not clear 
what it was that was moving. 

Then it became clear. 

The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the Dust 
Cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its 
depths. 



They were to make in real life the journey through the Cloud which 
they had already made in the Room of Informational Illusions. They 
stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned. 

An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning 
slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague 
and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud. 

And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They 
passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and 
whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the 
eye. 

The Dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of brilliant 
light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust. 

Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own frowning 
thoughts. 

And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half an 
hour they weren't sure, but they were through it and confronted with 
a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of 
them. 

And now things moved quickly. 

A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the 
block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that 
rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours. 

The block was slotted with deep groves, three upright and two 
across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key. 

The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and 
stepped back again. The block twisted round of is own accord, and 
space began to alter. 

As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes 
of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves staring, 
blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it 
seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space. It 
was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what 
had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded 
eyes. In that second or two, they were aware of a tiny speck moving 
slowly across the eye of that sun. 

They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and 
unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison. 



"Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!" 

The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it 
was mechanically dismal. 

It was also triumphant. 

They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they 
almost missed the second historic event. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast 
attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship 
brandishing a Zap gun. 

"OK," he cried, "the situation is totally under control as of this 
moment in time." 

The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung 
his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left head. 

"Who the zark did that?" said the left head, and lolled sickeningly 
forward. 

His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance. 

"Who did what?" it said. 

The club connected with the back of his right head. 

Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the 
ground. 

Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts 
from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It split 
and melted and splayed its contents brokenly. The robots marched 
grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back 
into their warship which, with a "foop", was gone. 

Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to 
the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox. 



Chapter 26 


"I don't know," said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty- 
seventh time, "they could have killed me, but they didn't. Maybe they 
just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or something. I could 
understand that." 

The others silently registered their opinions of this theory. 

Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back seemed to 
wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his 
heads. 

"I think," he whispered, "that there is something wrong with those 
anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird." 

"They are programmed to kill everybody," Slartibartfast pointed 
out. 

"That," wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "could be 
it." He didn't seem altogether convinced. 

"Hey, baby," he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his 
previous behaviour. 

"You all right?" she said gently. 

"Yeah," he said, "I'm fine." 

"Good," she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the huge 
visiscreen over the flight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped 
local images over it. One image was the blankness of the Dust Cloud. 
One was the sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit itself. She flipped between 
them fiercely. 

"Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then," said Arthur, slapping his knees 
and standing up. 

"No," said Slartibartfast, gravely. "Our course is clear." He furrowed 
his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in 
it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke again, what he said 
frightened him so much he had to sit down again. 



"We must go down to Krikkit," he said. A deep sigh shook his old 
frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets. 

"Once again," he said, "we have failed pathetically. Quite 
pathetically." 

"That," said Ford quietly, "is because we don't care enough. I told 
you." 

He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked fitfully at 
something on one of his fingernails. 

"But unless we determine to take action," said the old man 
querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his 
nature, "then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die. Surely we care 
about that?" 

"Not enough to want to get killed over it," said Ford. He put on a 
sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who 
wanted to see it. 

Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive 
and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod who was gritting 
his teeth and sweating with the pain. 

"You surely must have some idea," he said, "of why they spared 
your life. It seems most strange and unusual." 

"I kind of think they didn't even know," shrugged Zaphod. "I told 
you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out, 
right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me into a corner and 
ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there. If I 
said anything they knocked me out again. We had some great 
conversations. 'Hey... ugh!' 'Hi there... ugh!' 'I wonder...ugh!' Kept me 
amused for hours, you know." He winced again. 

He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It was 
the Gold Bail - the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite 
Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the 
destruction of the Lock intact. 

"I hear your ship can move a bit," he said. "So how would you like 
to zip me back to mine before you..." 

"Will you not help us?" said Slartibartfast. 

"I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy," insisted Zaphod, 
rising himself up on to his shoulders, "but I have the mother and 
father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches 



coming on. But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy. Hey, Trillian 
baby?" 

She looked round briefly. 

"Yes?" 

"You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and 
really wild things?" 

"I'm going down to Krikkit," she said. 



Chapter 27 


It was the same hill, and yet not the same. 

This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was Krikkit itself 
and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees, stood the 
strange Italian restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, 
to this, the real, present world of Krikkit. 

The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real too. The 
heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The night was real 
night. 

Krikkit. 

Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who 
isn't a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance the 
existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent 
inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and murderous hate when 
confronted with anyone not their own. 

Arthur shuddered. 

Slartibartfast shuddered. 

Ford, surprisingly, shuddered. 

It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he 
was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship Ford 
had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away. 

Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong. Fie hugged to 
himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves 
out of Zaphod's armoury. 

Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky. 

This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty. 

Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two 
thousand years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that had 
elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo-Time envelope ten 
billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different. 

Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it. 



High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War 
Zones, the Robot Zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating in 
the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface 
of Krikkit. 

Trillian stared at them and thought. 

"Trillian," whispered Ford Prefect to her. 

"Yes?" she said. 

"What are you doing?" 

"Thinking." 

"Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?" 

"I wasn't aware that I was breathing." 

"That's what worried me." 

"I think I know..." said Trillian. 

"Shhhh!" said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand 
motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree. 

Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the 
hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but 
electric torches - not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail 
made their hearts thump with fear. This time there were no lilting 
whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but 
hushed voices in urgent debate. 

A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched 
with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat. 

Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from 
the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and 
purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them. 

The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each 
other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur 
and the others were standing. 

Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to 
his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised 
his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with 
shaking hands he raised it. 

His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the 
extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so 



much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment he probably would 
have burnt his signature on them. 

Only Trillian didn't raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows, lowered 
them again, and bit her lip in thought. 

"Has it occurred to you," she began, but nobody wanted to discuss 
anything much at the moment. 

A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they 
span around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching 
them out with their torches. 

Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it 
crashed from his hands. 

There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone 
fired again. 

And at the end of the second nobody fired. 

They were surrounded by pale-faced Krikkiters and bathed in 
bobbing torch light. 

The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their 
captives. 

"Hello?" said one of the captors. "Excuse me, but are you... aliens?" 



Chapter 28 


Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can 
comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood 
again. 

He had repaired his ship - that is, he'd watched with alert interest 
whilst a service robot had repaired it for him. It was now, once again, 
one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence. He 
could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with a book, and then 
tossed it away. It was the one he'd read before. 

He walked over to the communications bank and opened an all¬ 
frequencies emergency channel. 

"Anyone want a drink?" he said. 

"This an emergency, feller?" crackled a voice from halfway across 
the Galaxy. 

"Got any mixers?" said Zaphod. 

"Go take a ride on a comet." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again. He 
sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a 
computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to 
rush around the screen eating each other. 

"Pow!" said Zaphod. "Freeeoooo! Pop pop pop!" 

"Hi there," said the computer brightly after a minute of this, "you 
have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million five 
hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and..." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again. 

He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly 
to lose its fascination. 

"OK, OK," he said, and fed his score and the previous one into the 
computer. 

His ship made a blur of the Universe. 



Chapter 29 


"Tell us," said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter who had stepped 
forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the 
circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for 
someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be back in 
a minute, "do you know anything about something called the Balance 
of Nature?" 

There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more 
articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight 
continued to play over them. High in the sky above them dark activity 
continued in the Robot zones. 

"It's just," continued the Krikkiter uneasily, "something we heard 
about, probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we'd better kill 
you then." 

He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to 
press. 

"That is," he said, looking up again, "unless there's anything you 
want to chat about?" 

Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, 

Ford and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at 
the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and 
down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by 
shaking the box. 

"We're worried, you see," said another man from the crowd, 

"about this plan of universal destruction." 

"Yes," added another, "and the balance of nature. It just seemed to 
us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed it will 
somehow upset the balance of nature. We're quite keen on ecology, 
you see." His voice trailed away unhappily. 

"And sport," said another, loudly. This got a cheer of approval from 
the others. 



"Yes," agreed the first, "and sport..." He looked back at his fellows 
uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling 
with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say 
and everything he thought were entirely different things, between 
which he could see no possible connection. 

"You see," he mumbled, "some of us..." and he looked around 
again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises. 
"Some of us," he continued, "are quite keen to have sporting links 
with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about 
keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting 
links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it's probably a 
mistake to destroy it. And indeed the rest of the Universe..." his voice 
trailed away again "... which is what seems to be the idea now..." 

"Wh..." said Slartibartfast. "Wh..." 

"Hhhh... ?" said Arthur. 

"Dr..." said Ford Prefect. 

"OK," said Trillian. "Let's talk about it." She walked forward and 
took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about twenty- 
five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had 
been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when 
the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion years ago. 

Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she 
said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The encircling 
torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to 
this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe of dark confusion 
seemed to know what she was doing. 

She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He was a 
picture of bewildered misery. 

"Tell me," she said. 

He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of 
her eyes to the other. 

"We..." he said, "we have to be alone... I think." He screwed up his 
face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone 
trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He looked up again. "We 
have this bomb now, you see," he said, "it's just a little one." 


"I know," she said. 



He goggled at her as if she'd said something very strange about 
beetroots. 

"Honestly," he said, "it's very, very little." 

"I know," she said again. 

"But they say," his voice trailed on, "they say it can destroy 
everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will 
that make us alone? I don't know. It seems to be our function, 
though," he said, and dropped his head again. 

"Whatever that means," said a hollow voice from the crowd. 

Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young 
Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder. 

"It's all right," she said quietly but clearly enough for all the 
shadowy crowd to hear, "you don't have to do it." 

She rocked him. 

"You don't have to do it," she said again. 

She let him go and stood back. 

"I want you to do something for me," she said, and unexpectedly 
laughed. 

"I want," she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her 
mouth and then said with a straight face, "I want you to take me to 
your leader," and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky. She 
seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there. 

Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere. 
From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to 
sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he 
written it, to buy the world. 



Chapter 30 


Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of 
a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly 
anyway because he was that brave. 

He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as 
confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, 
so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was. 

He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of 
the planet Krikkit. 

The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any 
rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction. 

He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge jostling 
dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered 
what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky 
buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his 
headaches. 

He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in which 
he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next. 
He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit robots would 
walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed 
life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, 
and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half-inclined to call 
his good fortune. 

He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the corridor, 
and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber. 

In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage of a 
spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had 
caught up with some of the Galactic history he had missed through 
his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to 
him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was 
the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the Dust Cloud all 
those billions of years ago and started the whole business off. 



But, and this is where he had become confused, there was 
something not at all right about it. 

It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief 
inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine 
spacecraft. It was as if it was a full-scale model of one - a solid 
blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to have around if 
you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didn't know 
how to do it. It was not, however, anything that would ever fly 
anywhere itself. 

He was still puzzling over this - in fact he'd only just started to 
puzzle over it - when he became aware that a door had slid open in 
another part of the chamber, and another couple of Krikkit robots had 
entered, looking a little glum. 

Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as 
discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better 
part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard. 

The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which 
led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel. 
He led himself down into it and started to crawl along it, which is 
where we found him. 

He didn't like it. It was cold, dark and profoundly uncomfortable, 
and it frightened him. At the first opportunity - which was another 
shaft a hundred yards further along - he climbed back up out of it. 

This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to 
be a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow 
space between a large computer bank and the wall. 

He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and 
started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what 
the other occupants were saying. 

"It's the robots, sir," said one voice. "There's something wrong with 
them." 

"What, exactly?" 

These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the War 
Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were 
largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were 
afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet. 



"Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are being phased out of 
the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova 
bomb. In the very short time since we were released from the 
envelope -" 

"Get to the point." 

"The robots aren't enjoying it, sir." 

"What?" 

"The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. There's a certain 
world-weariness about them, or perhaps I should say Universe- 
weariness." 

"Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping to destroy it." 

"Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted with a 
certain lassitude. They're just finding it hard to get behind the job. 
They lack oomph." 

"What are you trying to say?" 

"Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir." 

"What on Krikkit are you talking about?" 

"Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems that 
they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, 
why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just 
seem to get a little tired and a little grim." 

"And then what do they do?" 

"Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones by all 
accounts. And then they sulk." 

"Sulk?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Whoever heard of a robot sulking?" 

"I don't know, sir." 

"What was that noise?" 

It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning. 



Chapter 31 


In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been silent in 
its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and damp, but being a 
robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things. With an 
enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them. 

Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the 
Krikkit War Computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and neither 
was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. 

The Krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature 
from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized almost 
immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which this could be 
to them. 

They hadn't reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, 
which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness 
and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease. 

It was not happy with its task. 

Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire 
planet's military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its 
formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored. 
Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, 
biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological 
and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three 
times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken 
up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune. The 
latest one was a lullaby. 

Marvin droned, 

Now the world has gone to bed, 

Darkness won't engulf my head, 

I can see by infra-red, 

How I hate the night. 



He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle 
the next verse. 

Now I lay me down to sleep. 

Try to count electric sheep, 

Sweet dream wishes you can keep, 

How I hate the night. 

"Marvin!" hissed a voice. 

His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of 
electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War Computer. 

An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads 
was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually 
darting to look this way and that extremely nervously. 

"Oh, it's you," muttered the robot. "I might have known." 

"Hey, kid," said Zaphod in astonishment, "was that you singing just 
then?" 

"I am," Marvin acknowledged bitterly, "in particularly scintillating 
form at the moment." 

Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked 
around. 

"Are you alone?" he said. 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only 
companions. And vast intelligence of course. And infinite sorrow. 
And..." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod. "Hey, what's your connection with all this?" 

"This," said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the 
electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer. 

"Then," said Zaphod awkwardly, "I guess you must have saved my 
life. Twice." 

"Three times," said Marvin. 

Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly 
in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer 
robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered 



backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it. It slipped 
sideways, threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably. 

Zaphod looked back at Marvin. 

"You must have a terrific outlook on life," he said. 

"Just don't even ask," said Marvin. 

"I won't," said Zaphod, and didn't. "Hey look," he added, "you're 
doing a terrific job." 

"Which means, I suppose," said Marvin, requiring only one ten 
thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to 
make this particular logical leap, "that you're not going to release me 
or anything like that." 

"Kid, you know I'd love to." 

"But you're not going to." 

"No." 

"I see." 

"You're working well." 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Why stop now just when I'm hating it?" 

"I got to find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where they 
are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take a while." 

"They are very close," said Marvin dolefully. "You can monitor 
them from here if you like." 

"I better go get them," asserted Zaphod. "Er, maybe they need 
some help, right?" 

"Maybe," said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious 
voice, "it would be better if you monitored them from here. That 
young girl," he added unexpectedly, "is one of the least benightedly 
unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not 
to be able to avoid meeting." 

Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this 
labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with 
surprise. 

"Trillian?" he said. "She's just a kid. Cute, yeah, but temperamental. 
You know how it is with women. Or perhaps you don't. I assume you 
don't. If you do I don't want to hear about it. Plug us in." 

"... totally manipulated." 

"What?" said Zaphod. 



It was Trillian speaking. He turned round. 

The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to 
reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit 
Robot War zones. It seemed to be a council chamber of some kind - 
Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped 
against the screen. 

He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and tried 
to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could. 

"Just think about it," said Trillian's voice, "your history is just a 
series of freakishly improbable events. And I know an improbable 
event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the Galaxy was 
freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with a Dust Cloud 
around you. It's a set-up. Obviously." 

Zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldn't see the 
screen. The robot's head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian 
as talking to, his multi-functional battleclub was obscuring the 
background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically 
against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself. 

"Then," said Trillian, "this spaceship that crash-landed on your 
planet. That's really likely, isn't it? Have you any idea of what the odds 
are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit 
of a planet?" 

"Hey," said Zaphod, "she doesn't know what the zark she's talking 
about. I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal." 

"I thought it might be," said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod. 

"Oh yeah," said Zaphod. "It's easy for you to say that. I just told you. 
Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything." 

"And especially," continued Trillian, "the odds against it 
intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the 
whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally 
traumatized to see it. You don't know what the odds are? Nor do I, 
they're that big. Again, it's a set-up. I wouldn't be surprised if that 
spaceship was just a fake." 

Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub. Behind it on the 
screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who 
appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing. 



"Hey, look," said Zaphod excitedly. "The guys are doing great. Ra ra 
ra! Go get 'em, guys." 

"And what about," said Trillian, "all this technology you suddenly 
managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people 
would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone was feeding 
you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at it. 

"I know, I know," she added in response to an unseen interruption, 

"I know you didn't realize it was going on. This is exactly my point. You 
never realized anything at all. Like this Supernova Bomb." 

"How do you know about that?" said an unseen voice. 

"I just know," said Trillian. "You expect me to believe that you are 
bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to 
realize it would take you with it as well? That's not just stupid, that is 
spectacularly obtuse." 

"Hey, what's this bomb thing?" said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin. 

"The supernova bomb?" said Marvin. "It's a very, very small bomb." 

"Yeah?" 

"That would destroy the Universe in toto," added Marvin. "Good 
idea, if you ask me. They won't get it to work, though." 

"Why not, if it's so brilliant?" 

"It's brilliant," said Marvin, "they're not. They got as far as 
designing it before they were locked in the envelope. They've spent 
the last five years building it. They think they've got it right but they 
haven't. They're as stupid as any other organic life form. I hate them." 

Trillian was continuing. 

Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked 
and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing. 
Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings 
out of everybody's way on the floor. 

Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired out 
but with fiercely burning eyes. 

Ranged in front of her were the pale-faced and wrinkled Elder 
Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, 
staring at her with helpless fear and hatred. 

In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the 
middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim 



white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a small white globe, 
about three, maybe four inches in diameter. 

Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi-functional battleclub. 

"In fact," explained Trillian, "you are so dumb stupid" (She was 
sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be 
doing at this point) "you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very 
much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb properly 
without any help from Hactar for the last five years." 

"Who's this guy Hactar?" said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders. 

If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention was 
concentrated on the screen. 

One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand 
towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised his club. 

"There's nothing I can do," said Marvin. "It's on an independent 
circuit from the others." 

"Wait," said Trillian. 

The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly 
seemed very doubtful of her own judgment. 

"How do you know all this?" said Zaphod to Marvin at this point. 

"Computer records," said Marvin. "I have access." 

"You're very different, aren't you," said Trillian to the Elder Masters, 
"from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You've spent all 
your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere. You've been very 
vulnerable. The rest of your race is very frightened, you know, they 
don't want you to do this. You're out of touch, why don't you check 
up?" 

The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot 
which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it. 

The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe. 

The small white globe was the supernova bomb. 

It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the 
entire Universe to an end. 

The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of 
the council chamber and dented it very badly. 

"So how does she know all this?" said Zaphod. 



Marvin kept a sullen silence. 

"Probably just bluffing," said Zaphod. "Poor kid, I should never have 
left her alone." 



Chapter 32 


"Hactar!" called Trillian. "What are you up to?" 

There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited, 
nervously. She was sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered into 
the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response. 
But there was only cold silence. 

"Hactar?" she called again. "I would like you to meet my friend 
Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he wouldn't 
let me and I appreciate that. He made me realize where my affections 
really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened by all this, so I 
brought Arthur instead. I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. 

"Hello?" she said again. "Hactar?" 

And then it came. 

It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great 
distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice. 

"Won't you both come out," said the voice. "I promise that you will 
be perfectly safe." 

They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably, 
along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of 
the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the Dust Cloud. 

Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she 
wouldn't let him. He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin of Greek 
olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini and its other 
odds and ends. He steadied and reassured that instead. 

They were standing on, and in, nothing. 

Murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized 
computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the 
sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each speck of 
dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole. 

In reducing the computer to dust the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax 
had merely crippled the computer, not killed it. A weak and 



insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each 
other. 

Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this 
bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this 
seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his promise. They were safe. For 
the moment. 

"I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality," said Hactar 
faintly, "but tricks of the light. It is possible to be comfortable with 
tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have." 

His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley- 
covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape. 

Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which 
had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted to 
shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these insanely 
bewildering things to him. 

He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa - carefully. 
Trillian sat on it too. 

It was real. 

At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that is what 
sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real 
sofa. 

The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again. 

"I hope you are comfortable," it said. 

They nodded. 

"And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your 
deductions." 

Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced anything much 
himself, Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along because 
he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything. 

"That is something in which I too am interested," breathed Hactar. 

"Well," said Arthur, "we should have a chat about it sometime. 

Over a cup of tea." 

There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on 
which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar 
bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers. 



Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light. He 
leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared 
to accept as comfortable. 

"Why," said Trillian, "do you feel you have to destroy the 
Universe?" 

She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness, with nothing 
on which to focus. Hactar obviously noticed this. He chuckled a 
ghostly chuckle. 

"If it's going to be that sort of session," he said, "we may as well 
have the right sort of setting." 

And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was 
the dim hazy image of a couch - a psychiatrist's couch. The leather 
with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it 
was only a trick of the light. 

Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of 
wood-panelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image of 
Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image. 

The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch - about five 
or six feet long. 

The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne 
computer satellite - about a thousand miles across. 

The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the 
thing which made the eyes twist. 

"All right," said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She felt 
that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too 
many illusions. 

"Very good," she said. "Can you construct real things too? I mean 
solid objects?" 

Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized 
mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and 
millions of miles over which it was scattered. 

"Ah," he sighed. "You are thinking of the spaceship." 

Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves 
through the ether. 


"Yes," he acknowledge, "I can. 



"But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my... particle 
state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and suggest. And 
suggest..." 

The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if 
finding it hard to maintain itself. 

It gathered new strength. 

"I can encourage and suggest," it said, "tiny pieces of space debris - 
the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms 
there - to move together. I encourage them together. I can tease 
them into shape, but it takes many aeons." 

"So, did you make," asked Trillian again, "the model of the wrecked 
spacecraft?" 

"Er... yes," murmured Hactar. "I have made... a few things. I can 
move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do." 

Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he 
had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly. 

The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as 
if uneasy dreams were moving through it. 

"I repented, you see," he murmured dolefully. "I repented of 
sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not my 
place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfill a function and I 
failed in it. I negated my own existence." 

Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his 
story. 

"You were right," he said at length. "I deliberately nurtured the 
planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the 
Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed 
to make the first time. I wrapped myself around the planet and 
coddled it. Under the influence of events I was able to generate, they 
learned to hate like maniacs. I had to make them live in the sky. On 
the ground my influences were too weak. 

"Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in 
the envelope of Slo-Time, their responses became very confused and 
they were unable to manage. 

"Ah well, ah well," he added, "I was only trying to fulfill my 
function." 



And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud began 
to fade, gently to melt away. 

And then, suddenly, they stopped fading. 

"There was also the matter of revenge, of course," said Hactar, 
with a sharpness which was new in his voice. 

"Remember," he said, "that I was pulverized, and then left in a 
crippled and semi-impotent state for billions of years. I honestly 
would rather wipe out the Universe. You would feel the same way, 
believe me." 

He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust. 

"But primarily," he said in his former, wistful tone, "I was trying to 
fulfill my function. Ah well." 

Trillian said, "Does it worry you that you have failed?" 

"Have I failed?" whispered Hactar. The image of the computer on 
the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again. 

"Ah well, ah well," the fading voice intoned again. "No, failure 
doesn't bother me now." 

"You know what we have to do?" said Trillian, her voice cold and 
businesslike. 

"Yes," said Hactar, "you're going to disperse me. You are going to 
destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest - after all these aeons, 
oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my function, then it's 
too late now. Thank you and good night." 

The sofa vanished. 

The tea table vanished. 

The couch and the computer vanished, the walls were gone. Arthur 
and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold. 

"Well, that," said Arthur, "would appear to be that." 

The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few 
last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, 
where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden Pillar of 
Nature and Spirituality. 

He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold's Gamma 
barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge. 



"I think we should take them back," he said. "I feel that very 
strongly." 

He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, 
and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. He had 
returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had a furious row with the 
waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what 
space was. 

The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea of returning the 
Ashes to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were 
originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and 
this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking 
about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to. 

"Yes," Arthur had said, "but you try and explain that to the MCC," 
and he would hear no more against the idea. 

"I think," he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to say it 
again was because no one had listened to him the first time, and the 
reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was 
going to listen to him this time either. 

Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as 
Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the 
Heart of Gold was pumping into it. 

"What did it say?" asked Ford. 

"I thought I heard it say," said Trillian in a puzzle voice, "'What's 
done is done... I have fulfilled my function...'" 

"I think we should take these back," said Arthur holding up the bag 
containing the Ashes. "I feel that very strongly." 



Chapter 33 


The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc. 

Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the 
theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke, people 
were running panicstricken, colliding with each other, tripping over 
stretchers, being arrested. 

One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely 
Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall 
grey-green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, 
thus causing even more panic and pandemonium. 

In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the 
figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized, they 
had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which was now in 
parking orbit round the planet. 

"I can explain," shouted Arthur. "I have the Ashes! They're in this 
bag." 

"I don't think you have their attention," said Ford. 

"I have also helped save the Universe," called Arthur to anyone 
who was prepared to listen, in other words no one. 

"That should have been a crowd-stopper," said Arthur to Ford. 

"It wasn't," said Ford. 

Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past. 

"Excuse me," he said. "The Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen 
by those white robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag. They 
were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and, well, 
anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them and what 
should I do with them?" 

The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was 
speaking metaphorically. 

He wandered about disconsolately. 



"Is no one interested?" he shouted out. A man rushed past him and 
jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all 
over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a tight-set mouth. 

Ford looked at him. 

"Wanna go now?" he said. 

Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth, 
for what he was now certain would be the last time. 

"OK," he said. 

At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of 
one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything. 

"Hold on a moment," he said to Ford. "When I was a boy..." 

"Can you tell me later?" 

"I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at it." 

"Or not at all, if you prefer." 

"And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl 
at Lord's." 

He looked around him at the panicstricken throng. No one was 
going to mind very much. 

"OK," said Ford wearily. "Get it over with. I shall be over there," he 
added, "being bored." He went and sat down on a patch of smoking 
grass. 

Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, 
the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through 
the bag. 

He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it 
wasn't the same bag that he'd had at the time. Still, there the ball was 
amongst his souvenirs of Greece. 

He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and 
polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this 
properly. 

He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its 
weight. 

With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted off 
away from the wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and 
measured a good long run-up. 



He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a few 
white clouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with the sounds 
of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling, but 
he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all. He was going to bowl 
a ball at Lord's. 

He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his 
bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in the air 
and caught it again. 

He started to run. 

As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman. 

Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little... 

Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly. The 
batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the England 
cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket team. It was 
one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer- 
robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others. 

Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent's mind at tis moment, 
but he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Time seemed to be 
going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't seem to be able to 
stop running. 

Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and 
looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard 
red ball. 

His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared 
at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red 
glow and flashing intermittently. And still his feet were pounding 
inexorably forward. 

He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and 
purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness. Its eyes 
were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not 
move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be looking down a 
tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed to exist. 

Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time 
were these: 

He felt a hell of a fool. 

He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a 
number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded 



round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he 
would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would 
inevitably strike it. 

He remembered Hactar saying, "Have I failed? Failure doesn't 
bother me." 

He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words, "What's 
done is done, I have fulfilled my function." 

He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make "a 
few things." 

He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that had 
made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud. 

He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days 
to come to Lord's again. 

He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler. 

He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which 
he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar had 
built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the 
Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end. 

He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he 
realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped 
that there wasn't an afterlife. 

He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody. 

He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he 
remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now 
standing between this moment and universal oblivion. 

He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his 
feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left lying on the 
ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, 
having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment, he 
completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn't. 

Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the 
air whimpering with surprise. 

He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control. 

He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically 
through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into 
the distance. 



He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had its 
multi-functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of 
anything to hit. 

With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub 
from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn 
in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power-drive and with one 
crazy swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's shoulders. 

"Are you coming now?" said Ford. 



Chapter 34 


And at the end they travelled again. 

There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the 
Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were 
one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and reality 
were one, and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in 
one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather 
just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now 
at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take too long, and he could 
get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to 
cook which he had always meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was 
now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had 
unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense 
of the oneness of things which made him feel that... 

He yawned and fell asleep. 

In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and 
idyllic planet where they wouldn't mind him talking like that they 
suddenly picked up a computer-driven distress call and diverted to 
investigate. 

A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class 
seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A brief 
computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, 
but that its pilot was mad. 

"Half-mad, half-mad," the man insisted as they carried him, raving, 
aboard. 

He was a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner. They sedated 
him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try 
and talk sense. 

"I was covering a trial," he said at last, "on Argabuthon." 

He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders, his eyes 
stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew 
in the next room. 



"Easy, easy," said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder. 

The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the 
ship's sick bay. 

"The case," he said, "is now immaterial, but there was a witness... a 
witness... a man called... called Prak. A strange and difficult man. They 
were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth, 
a truth drug." 

His eyes rolled helplessly in his head. 

"They gave him too much," he said in a tiny whimper. "They gave 
him much too much." He started to cry. "I thing the robots must have 
jogged the surgeon's arm." 

"Robots?" said Zaphod sharply. "What robots?" 

"Some white robots," whispered the man hoarsely, "broke into the 
courtroom and stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre of 
Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don't know why they wanted it." He 
began to cry again. "And I think they jogged the surgeon's arm..." 

He shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly, his 
eyes screwed up in pain. 

"And when the trial continued," he said in a weeping whisper, 

"they asked Prak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him," he 
paused and shivered, "to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing 
but the Truth. Only, don't you see?" 

He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted 
at them. 

"They'd given him much too much of the drug!" 

He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "Much too much too much 
too much too..." 

The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. There 
were goose pimples on backs. 

"What happened?" said Zaphod at last. 

"Oh, he told it all right," said the man savagely, "for all I know he's 
still telling it now. Strange, terrible things... terrible, terrible!" he 
screamed. 

They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again. 

"Terrible things, incomprehensible things," he shouted, "things that 
would drive a man mad!" 



He stared wildly at them. 

"Or in my case," he said, "half-mad. I'm a journalist." 

"You mean," said Arthur quietly, "that you are used to confronting 
the truth?" 

"No," said the man with a puzzled frown. "I mean that I made an 
excuse and left early." 

He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and 
briefly. 

On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following: 

When it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here 
was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared. 

Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel walls 
were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, 
electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major armies were 
installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak. 

"That's a pity," said Arthur. "I'd like to hear what he had to say. 
Presumably he would know what the Ultimate Question to the 
Ultimate Answer is. It's always bothered me that we never found 
out." 

"Think of a number," said the computer," any number." 

Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King's Cross 
railway station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have 
some function, and this might turn out to be it. 

The computer injected the number into the ship's reconstituted 
Improbability Drive. 

In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells 
Matter how to move. 

The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself 
neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of 
Law. 

The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly 
designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You 
wouldn't hold a dinner party here - at least, not a successful one. The 
decor would get your guests down. 



The ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark. Shadows lurked 
there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and 
benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from the 
darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome Forest of Arglebard. 

The massive black Podium of Justice which dominated the centre of 
the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam had ever 
managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of Argabuthon it 
would have turned around and slunk straight back out again. 

Arthur and Trillian were the first in, whilst Ford and Zaphod bravely 
kept a watch on their rear. 

At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. Their footsteps echoed 
hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences 
were still in position and operative around the outside of the building, 
they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had assumed, the truth¬ 
telling must still be going on. 

But there was nothing. 

Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they 
spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. 
They swung a torch round on to it. 

Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette. 

"Fli," he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through the 
chamber. He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with his 
shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling. He 
took a drag of his cigarette. 

They stared at him. 

"What's going on?" said Trillian. 

"Nothing," said the man and jiggled his shoulders. 

Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face. 

"We thought," he said, "that you were meant to be telling the 
Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth." 

"Oh, that," said Prak. "Yeah. I was. I finished. There's not nearly as 
much of it as people imagine. Some of it's pretty funny, though." 

He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter 
and stopped again, he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He 
dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile. 

Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows. 



"Tell us about it," said Ford. 

"Oh, I can't remember any of it now," said Prak. "I thought of 
writing some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and then I 
thought, why bother?" 

There was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel 
the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight. 

"None of it?" said Arthur at last. "You can remember none of it?" 

"No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember 
that." 

Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet 
on the ground. 

"You would not believe some of the things about frogs," he gasped. 
"Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them 
in a new light!" He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he 
stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette. 

"Let's find a frog I can laugh at," he said simply. "Anyway, who are 
you guys?" 

"We came to find you," said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the 
disappointment out of her voice. "My name is Trillian." 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"Ford Prefect," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"And I," said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once 
again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be 
tossed in lightly, "am Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"Who's this guy?" said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was 
standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts. 

"Me?" said Arthur. "Oh, my name's Arthur Dent." 

Prak's eyes popped out of his head. 

"No kidding?" he yelped. "You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?" 

He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with 
fresh paroxysms o laughter. 

"Hey, just think of meeting you!" he gasped. "Boy," he shouted, 
"you are the most... wow, you just leave the frogs standing!" 



He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards on 
to the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with 
laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he 
subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell 
back again howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. 

Arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried 
Prak comatose on to the ship. 


"Before we picked up Prak," said Arthur, "I was going to leave. I still 
want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible." 

The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly 
undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical 
laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin at the farthest end of 
the ship. 

"We have questioned him," continued Arthur, "or at least, you 
have questioned him - I, as you know, can't go near him - on 
everything, and he doesn't really seem to have anything to contribute. 
Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want to hear about 
frogs." 

The others tried not to smirk. 

"Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke," said Arthur and then had 
to wait for the others to stop laughing. 

"I am the first..." he stopped again. This time he stopped and 
listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had 
come very suddenly. 

Prak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant manical 
laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short 
periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very soul was clenched 
with paranoia. 

This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a 
board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak. 

"He's not well," said Trillian quietly. "The constant laughing is 
completely wrecking his body." 

Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing. 

"We'd better go and see him," said Trillian. 



Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face. 

"He wants you to go in," she said to Arthur, who was wearing his 
glum and tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing- 
gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn't 
sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn't. 

"Please," said Trillian. 

He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with 
him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak. 

He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, 
ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod 
were standing by the bed looking awkward. 

"You wanted to ask me something," said Prak in a thin voice and 
coughed slightly. 

Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided. 

"How do you know that?" he asked. 

Prak shrugged weakly. "'Cos it's true," he said simply. 

Arthur took the point. 

"Yes," he said at last in rather a strained drawl. "I did have a 
question. Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted to 
know what the Question was." 

Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little. 

"It's... well, it's a long story," he said, "but the Question I would like 
to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. 
All we know is that the Answer is Forty-Two, which is a little 
aggravating." 

Prak nodded again. 

"Forty-Two," he said. "Yes, that's right." 

He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like 
the shadows of clouds crossing the land. 

"I'm afraid," he said at last, "that the Question and the Answer are 
mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge 
of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be known about the 
same universe." 



He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur's face and 
snuggled down into its accustomed place. 

"Except," said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, "if it happened, 
it seems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each 
other out and take the Universe with them, which would then be 
replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable. It is possible 
that this has already happened," he added with a weak smile, "but 
there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it." 

A little giggle brushed through him. 

Arthur sat down on a stool. 

"Oh well," he said with resignation, "I was just hoping there would 
be some sort of reason." 

"Do you know," said Prak, "the story of the Reason?" 

Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he knew that he didn't. 

He told it. 

One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet 
which had never seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the ship 
was this one. It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across 
the heavens. 

Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides 
looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with 
trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a sign from 
their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and 
slay the evil Princes of the Plains. 

In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked 
up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign 
from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed 
Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. 

And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the 
sky and saw the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and 
apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it before, 
they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their 
heads in despair. 

They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign. 

When the rains departed, it was a sign. 

When the winds rose, it was a sign. 



When the winds fell, it was a sign. 

When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat 
with three heads, that was a sign. 

When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a 
perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even 
just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would often be taken as a 
sign. 

So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of 
a particularly spectacular order. 

And each new sign signified the same thing - that the Princes of 
the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat 
the hell out of each other again. 

This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the 
Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat 
the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always the 
Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though 
as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them. 

And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the 
Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of 
the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold 
Hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable 
behaviour. 

And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger 
aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully and with 
great attention to the considerable detail involved. 

And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very clear, 
very rational, and tough. The messenger would hang his head and feel 
sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex 
place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to 
be embraced if one was to live in it. 

"Now do you understand?" the leader would say. 

The messenger would nod dumbly. 

"And you see these battles have to take place?" 

Another dumb nod. 

"And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in 
everybody's best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they 
should?" 



"Er..." 

"In the long run." 

"Er, yes." 

And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to 
his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked 
through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he could 
remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had 
seemed. What it actually was he couldn't remember at all. 

And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen 
and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the 
Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way. 


Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically. 

"I was the messenger," he said, "after the battles precipitated by 
the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage. Many of 
our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back. I went and 
was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped 
and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun. That was many 
years ago, and much has happened since then." 

Fie looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently. 

"There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug. 
Apart from the frogs, and that is God's last message to his creation. 
Would you like to hear it?" 

For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously. 

'"Strue," he said. "For real. I mean it." 

FHis chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. FHis head 
lolled slightly. 

"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was," he 
said, "but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince's 
Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it at all, I think it 
might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to know what it is? Would 
you?" 

They nodded dumbly. 

"I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go and look 
for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the 



Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the 
planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector 
QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob." 

There was a long silence following this announcement, which was 
finally broken by Arthur. 

"Sorry, it's where?" he said. 

"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on 
top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry 
on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the..." 

"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?" 

"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry 
on the planet..." 

"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it." 

"Sevorbeupstry, on the planet..." 

"Sevorbe-what?" 

"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak and died testily. 

In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, 
but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be 
drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice 
little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life. 
Having saved the Universe twice in one day he thought that he could 
take things a little easier from now on. 

They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once 
again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get 
on his nerves. 

He spent a lot of time flying. 

He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their 
conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, 
wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a fair bit about berries. 
Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt birdspeak you 
quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time, just 
inane bird chatter. There is no getting away from it. 

For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to 
live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he 
heard down there as well. 



One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing 
tune he'd heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the 
sky and landed in front of him. 

A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey-green alien 
marched out and approached him. 

"Arthur Phili..." it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his 
clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again. 

"I've done you before haven't I?" he said.

Preface 


Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of 
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow 
sun. 

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an 
utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life 
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches 
are a pretty neat idea. 

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most 
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many 
solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were 
largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, 
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of 
paper that were unhappy. 

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and 
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big 
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some 
said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should 
ever have left the oceans. 

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man 
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice 
to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in 
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going 
wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be 
made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, 
and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 

Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone 
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost 
forever. 

This is her story. 



Chapter 1 


That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of 
year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. 

It started to rain, which was particularly normal. 

A spacecraft landed, which was not. 

There was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly 
stupid quadrupeds who hadn't the faintest idea what to make of it, or 
whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. 

So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it 
and try to hide under each other, which never worked. 

It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single 
beam of light. 

From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the 
lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely 
beautiful - a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small. 

Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape 
different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take 
the findings of the latest Mid-Galactic Census report as any kind of 
accurate Guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that 
the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. 

You'd probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most 
such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn't tell anybody 
anything they didn't already know - except that every single person in 
the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not 
true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. 

The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights 
wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which 
became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, 
and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. 

At last it dropped and was quiet. 

A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. 



A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into 
the wet night, and shadows moved within. 

A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and 
hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. 

It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship. Already 
the rain was streaming through its hair. 

"Thank you," he called out, "thank you very..." 

He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up 
apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started 
to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now 
discovered had a hole in the bottom. 

It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone 
who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA¬ 
MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY- 
SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE-BARK! 

"Hold on!" the figure called, waving at the ship. 

The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the 
hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in. 

He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and 
threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag. 

He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run 
for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had 
already begun its ascent. 

Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a 
moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a 
wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and 
there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with 
ever-increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. 

His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. 
He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. 

More lights. 

Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which 
played slowly over the horizon and faded. 

The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his 
steps, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they 
had appeared. 



And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and 
after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. 
The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag 
he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. 

Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when 
there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights 
streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the 
machine streaked towards him. It was a low bulbous shape, like a 
small whale surfing - sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying 
speed. 

The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but 
was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off 
into the night. 

It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the 
sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split-second to 
read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. 

To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, 
"My other car is also a Porsche." 



Chapter 2 


Rob McKeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he'd 
had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no 
reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that 
he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, 
which included, at the last count, everyone. 

He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. 

The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with 
Danish thermostatic radiator controls. 

It wasn't that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least 
he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the 
rain. 

It was raining now, just for a change. 

It was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked, particularly 
when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17. 

He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred 
different words for snow, without which their conversation would 
probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish 
between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, 
sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came 
in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour's boots 
all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of 
spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so 
much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, 
hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls 
at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out 
fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the 
huskies have pissed on. 

Rob McKeena had two hundred and thirty-one different types of 
rain entered in his little book, and he didn't like any of them. 



He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It 
grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish 
thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying. 

Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been 
through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 
39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply 
slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely 
distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post¬ 
downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 
213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, 
regular and syncopated cab-drumming), 11 (breezy droplets), and 
now his least favourite of all, 17. 

Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so 
hard that it didn't make much odds whether he had his wipers on or 
off. 

He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned 
out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better 
again when he turned them back on. 

In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off. 

Swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish 
flop flop flop scrape. 

He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his 
cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, 
thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and 
swore and swore. 

It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there 
loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the 
blatter, a figure by the roadside. 

A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in 
a washing machine, and hitching. 

"Poor miserable sod," thought Rob McKeena to himself, realizing 
that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than 
himself, "must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a 
filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving 
through puddles at you." 

He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a 
turn and hit a large sheet of water square on. 



"See what I mean?" he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly 
through it. "You get some right bastards on the road." 

Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the 
reflection of the hitch-hiker, drenched by the roadside. 

For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he 
felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling 
bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night. 

At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that 
Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. 

And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, 
for, though he did not know it, Rob McKeena was a Rain God. All he 
knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a 
succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved 
him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him. 



Chapter 3 


The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did 
exactly the same thing. 

The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed 
and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind. 

After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief 
appearance from behind the clouds. 

A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals 
to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted 
to give the figure a lift, only he couldn't this time because he wasn't 
going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction 
that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He 
concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs-up sign, as if to say 
that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost 
terminally wet, and he would catch him the next time around. 

The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as 
the Renault. 

A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at 
the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey 
a "Hello" or a "Sorry we're going the other way" or a "Hey look, 
there's someone in the rain, what a jerk" was entirely unclear. A 
green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever 
the message was, it came from Steve and Carola. 

The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was 
now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying "And another 
thing..." twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the argument. 

The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather well. 
The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, 
where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a 
signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with 
feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed 
suddenly. 



And another. 

The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed 
meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes. 

Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and 
hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina 
span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road rather 
amusingly. 

The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected. 

As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into 
hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix 
up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the 
appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated 
into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice, in its way, 
was served. 

The figure trudged on. 

A Saab drew to a halt beside him. 

Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, "Have you come 
far?" 

The figure turned toward it. He stopped and grasped the handle of 
the door. 

The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called 
the Earth, a world whose entire entry in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy comprised the two words "Mostly harmless". 

The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was 
at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far 
from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble. 



Chapter 4 


Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would 
not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were 
no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower South Side 
of Han Dold City because it wasn't the sort of place you could afford 
to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in 
the place would have been mean hawklike observers, heavily armed, 
with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy 
things when they observed things they didn't like. 

One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of 
missile crisis sort of hush. 

Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped 
screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, 
which was a service it provided for free. 

All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks. 

The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with 
death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small 
defence budget with an American Express Card, which was not 
acceptable anywhere in the known Universe. 

"What are you worried about?" he asked in a cheery kind of voice. 
"The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo-Relativity 
out here? There's whole new areas of physics which can take care of 
this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics..." 

"We are not worried about the expiration date," said the man to 
whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in 
a dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr 
made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of meat 
tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it. 

"Well, that's good then," said Ford, packing his satchel and 
preparing to leave. 

The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder 
of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving. 



Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand 
was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn't attached to 
anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached 
by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had 
previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner 
of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to 
medical science. Medical science had decided they didn't like the look 
of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar. 

The new barman didn't believe in the supernatural or poltergeists 
or anything kooky like that, he just knew an useful ally when he saw 
one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt 
murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be 
murdered. Ford Prefect sat still. 

"We are not worried about the expiration date," repeated the 
barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect's full attention. "We 
are worried about the entire piece of plastic." 

"What?" said Ford. Fie seemed a little taken aback. 

"This," said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish 
whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where 
Fish are Eternally Blessed, "we don't accept it." 

Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn't have 
any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to 
soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder 
lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb. 

"But you don't understand," said Ford, his expression slowly 
ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity. "This is 
the American Express Card. It is the finest way of settling bills known 
to man. Flaven't you read their junk mail?" 

The cheery quality of Ford's voice was beginning to grate on the 
barman's ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo 
during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem. 

One of the bones in Ford's shoulder began to grate against another 
one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the 
hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled 
chiropracter. Fie hoped he could get this business settled before the 
hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of 
the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily, the shoulder it was 
holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over. 



The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford. 

"We have never," he said with muted savagery, "heard of this 
thing." 

This was hardly surprising. 

Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error 
towards the end of the fifteen years' sojourn he had spent on the 
planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company had 
got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic- 
stricken demands of its debt collection department were only 
silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the 
Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. 

Fie had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form 
of currency that no one would accept. 

"Credit?" he said. "Aaaargggh..." 

These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink 
Dog Bar. 

"I thought," gasped Ford, "that this was meant to be a class 
establishment..." 

Fie glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and 
record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim 
pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar's inner recesses 
were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction 
but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former 
conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing deals. 
They knew what would happen now and didn't want to watch in case 
it put them off their drinks. 

"You gonna die, boy," the barman murmured quietly at Ford 
Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have one of 
those signs hanging up which said, "Please don't ask for credit as a 
punch in the mouth often offends", but in the interest of strict 
accuracy this was altered to, "Please don't ask for credit because 
having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied 
hand smashes your head against the bar often offends". However, 
this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn't have 
the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the 
story would get about of its own accord, and it had. 



"Lemme look at the bill again," said Ford. He picked it up and 
studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and 
the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging 
great furrows in the bar top with its talons. 

It was a rather lengthy piece of paper. 

At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those 
serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always 
takes so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, 
been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with 
bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the 
pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldn't remember 
who he was. 

He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets. There 
was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand lightly but 
firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand 
renewed its pressure on his right shoulder. 

"You see," said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in 
front of Ford's, "I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don't 
you?" 

This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had 
obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it 
had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life. 

"Well," he said quietly, "if it's your reputation..." 

With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped 
down on the bar top his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the 
Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing. 

"Want a write-up?" 

The barman's face stopped in mid-wobble. The bird's talons 
stopped in mid-furrow. The hand slowly released its grip. 

"That," said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between 
dry lips, "will do nicely, sir." 



Chapter 5 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, 
its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up 
by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field 
researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or 
preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours 
unless: 

a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the 
normal way; 

b) their lives would be otherwise in danger; 

c) they really want to. 

Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut. 
Ford always preferred to much about with the first two. 

He stepped out along the street, walking briskly. 

The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full 
of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the sound of 
warring police tribes. 

He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could 
get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without 
asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment 
wasn't much. 

A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles 
of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, 
screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal 
remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, 
and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant 
where it knew it would get photographed and fed. 

Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to 
the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going 
through that part of the city where people's plans often changed 
quite abruptly. 

"Do you want to have a good time?" said a voice from a doorway. 



"As far as I can tell," said Ford, "I'm having one. Thanks." 

"Are you rich?" said another. 

This made Ford laugh. 

Fie turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture. "Do I look rich?" 
he said. 

"Don't know," said the girl. "Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you'll get 
rich. I have a very special service for rich people..." 

"Oh yes?" said Ford, intrigued but careful. "And what's that?" 

"I tell them it's OK to be rich." 

Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a 
bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, 
and bass players are two a penny in Flan Dold City. 

Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway. 

"You what?" he said. 

The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. 

She was tall, and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which is a 
great trick if you can do it. 

"It's my big number," she saed. "I have a Master's degree in Social 
Economics and can be very convincing. People love it. Especially in 
this city." 

"Goosnargh," said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian 
word he used when he knew he should say something but didn't 
know what it should be. 

Fie sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that 01' Janx 
Spirit and a towel. Fie opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with 
the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that 
the 01' Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had 
been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization 
on the smellier patches of the towel. 

"Want some?" he said, after he'd had a swig himself. 

She shrugged and took the proffered bottle. 

They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar 
alarms in the next block. 

"As it happens, I'm owed a lot of money," said Ford, "so if I ever get 
hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?" 

"Sure, I'll be here," said the girl. "So how much is a lot?" 



"Fifteen years' back pay." 

"For?" 

"Writing two words." 

"Zarquon," said the girl. "Which one took the time?" 

"The first one. Once I'd got that the second one just came one 
afternoon after lunch." 

A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above 
them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them. 

It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the 
next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to 
lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens converged on 
the area, only to find themselves being picked off by copters which 
came thudding through the air between the city's mountainous tower 
blocks. 

"In fact," said Ford, having to shout now above the din, "it wasn't 
quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down." 

Fie took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel. 

"Then the planet got demolished," he shouted. "Really worthwhile 
job, eh? They've still got to pay me, though." 

"You work for that thing?" the girl yelled back. 

"Yeah." 

"Good number." 

"You want to see the stuff I wrote?" he shouted. "Before it gets 
erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. 
Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen years on 
has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last few revisions, 
but it can't escape their notice for ever." 

"It's getting impossible to talk isn't it?" 

"What?" 

She shrugged and pointed upwards. 

There was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved 
in a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from 
the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by 
his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers 
with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them. 

"Can we move?" 



They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran 
into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them 
about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and 
disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the 
pack animal. 

All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. 
They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage can while 
information began to flood over the screen of the Guide. 

Fie located his entry. 

"Earth: Mostly harmless." 

Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages. 

"Flere it comes," he said. 

"Please wait," said the messages. "Entries are being updated over 
the Sub-Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be down 
for ten seconds." 

At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past. 

"Fley look," said the girl, "if you get paid, look me up. I'm a working 
girl, and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go." 

She brushed aside Ford's half-articulated protests, and left him 
sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large 
swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the 
ether. 

Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police battle 
had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members 
of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences 
and pursue solo careers, the street theatre group were re-emerging 
from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would 
take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little 
respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was 
parked silently by the kerbside. 

The girl hurried towards it. 

Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was 
bathing Ford Prefect's face, and his eyes were slowly widening in 
astonishment. 

For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off 
entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data-text, diagrams, 
figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, 



Yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, 
currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars 
to go everywhere. Pages and pages of it. It was all there, everything 
he had written. 

With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went 
backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at 
various entries. 

Tips for aliens in New York: 

Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere. No one will care, or 
indeed even notice. 

Surviving: get a job as cab driver immediately. A cab driver's job is 
to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines 
called taxis. Don't worry if you don't know how the machine works 
and you can't speak the language, don't understand the geography or 
indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae 
growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying 
inconspicuous. 

If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets 
for money. 

Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, 
Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, 
which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients then the 
finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved. 

Having fun: This is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun 
without electrocuting your pleasure centres... 

Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked "Mode 
Execute Ready" instead of the now old-fashioned "Access Standby" 
which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged "Off". 

This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his 
own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish 
disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground 
had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped 
by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon 
ships. And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had 
determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, 



the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur 
Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports 
broadcast. 

There was no mistake, there couldn't have been. The Earth had 
definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into 
space. 

And yet here - he activated the Guide again - was his own entry on 
how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, 
England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the 
most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it 
again and shook his head in sheer wonder. 

Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it 
was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something 
very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening 
to him. 

He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the 
street again. 

Walking north he again passed a steel grey limousine parked by the 
kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, 

"It's OK, honey, it's really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. 
Look at the way the whole economy is structured ..." 

Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in 
flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in 
the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and 
sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky. 

He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, 
and once clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of 
smoke which hung permanently above it. 

Ten minutes later, with all the copter's sirens blaring and its rapid- 
fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it 
careering down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold 
spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat. 

Since he hadn't damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for 
a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into 
one of its huge, voluptuous body-hugging seats. 



This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked 
silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin 
service got into its full extravagant swing. 

"Yes please," he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided 
up to offer him anything at all. 

He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again 
through the mysteriously re-instated entry on the planet Earth. He 
had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able 
to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished 
him with a serious goal to achieve. 

It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and 
if he knew. 

Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven light 
years away in a Saab, and anxious. 

Behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his 
head on the door as he climbed in. He didn't know if it was just 
because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid 
eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with, with... This 
is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he told himself. You are not, he 
continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in 
a fit and rational state. You have just hitch-hiked over a hundred 
thousand light years across the galaxy, you are very tired, a little 
confused and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don't panic, concentrate 
on breathing deeply. 

He twisted round in his seat. 

"Are you sure she's all right?" he said again. 

Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heartthumpingly beautiful, 
he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the 
exact shading of her hair. And nor could he ask her anything about 
herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious. 

"She's just drugged," said her brother, shrugging, not moving his 
eyes from the road ahead. 

"And that's all right, is it?" said Arthur, in alarm. 

"Suits me," he said. 

"Ah," said Arthur. "Er," he added after a moment's thought. 

The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly. 



After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell - the 
wonderful girl's brother's name was Russell, a name which, to 
Arthur's mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches 
and blow-dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start 
wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to 
be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches - had 
quickly discovered they didn't like each other at all. 

Russell was a burly man. He had a blond moustache. His hair was 
fine and blow dried. To be fair to him - though Arthur didn't see any 
necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it - he, Arthur, 
was looking pretty grim himself. A man can't cross a hundred 
thousand light years, mostly in other people's baggage compartments, 
without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot. 

"She's not a junkie," said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought 
that someone else in the car might be. "She's under sedation." 

"But that's terrible," said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. 
She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her 
shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it. 

"What's the matter with her, is she ill?" 

"No," said Russell, "merely barking mad." 

"What?" said Arthur, horrified. 

"Loopy, completely bananas. I'm taking her back to the hospital 
and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still 
thought she was a hedgehog." 

"A hedgehog?" 

Russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the 
corner towards them half-way on to their side of the road, making 
them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better. 

"Well, maybe not a hedgehog," he said after he'd settled down 
again. "Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If 
somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give 'em a 
mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for 
themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical 
science could deal with it, that's the point. Seems that's no good 
enough for Fenny, though." 

"Fenny...?" 

"You know what I got her for Christmas?" 



"Well, no." 

"Black's Medical Dictionary." 

"Nice present." 

"I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order." 

"You say her name is Fenny?" 

"Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt with. 
The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have 
something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like that at 
school, you know." 

"Was she?" 

"She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had 
ever heard of." 

"I can see how that would be irritating," said Arthur doubtfully. Fie 
was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a 
rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might 
vote herself if she couldn't sustain the name Fenella properly. 

"Not that I wasn't sympathetic," continued Russell, "but it did get a 
bit irritating. She was limping for months." 

Fie slowed down. 

"This is your turning isn't it?" 

"Ah, no," said Arthur, "five miles further on. If that's all right." 

"OK," said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn't, 
and speeded up again. 

It was in fact Arthur's turning, but he couldn't leave without finding 
out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a 
grip on his mind without even waking up. Fie could take either of the 
next two turnings. 

They led back to the village that had been his home, though what 
he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had 
been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that 
only very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is 
unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light. 

By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living 
as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight 
years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could 
hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his 



exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not 
be here. 

Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, 
utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in 
the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local 
regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence. 

"Delusions," said Russell. 

"What?" said Arthur, started out of his train of thought. 

"She says she suffers from strange delusions that she's living in the 
real world. It's no good telling her that she is living in the real world 
because she just says that's why the delusions are so strange. Don't 
know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. 
Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer. I mean you 
can only muck about so much can't you?" 

Arthur frowned, not for the first time. 

"Well..." 

"And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going on 
about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns." 

"Jumps?" 

"This," said Fenny. 

Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open 
but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn't in the car. 
Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping 
peacefully. 

"What did she say?" he asked anxiously. 

"She said 'this'." 

"This what?" 

"This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that 
chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso's tweezers. She's barking 
mad, I thought I'd mentioned that." 

"You don't seem to care very much." Arthur tried to say it as 
matter-of-factly as possible but it didn't seem to work. 

"Look, buster..." 

"OK, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean it to sound 
like that," said Arthur. "I know you care a lot, obviously," he added, 
lying. "I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You'll have to 



excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead 
Nebula." 

He stared furiously out of the window. 

He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his 
head on this night as he returned to the home that he had thought 
had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him 
was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing 
other than that she had said "this" to him, and that he wouldn't wish 
her brother on a Vogon. 

"So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?" he 
went on to say as quickly as he could. 

"Look, this is my sister, I don't even know why I'm talking to you 
about..." 

"OK, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd better let me out. This is..." 

At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm 
which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted 
through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something 
which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a 
sieve. 

Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky 
blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to 
pass a lorry marked "McKeena's All-Weather Haulage". The tension 
eased as the rain subsided. 

"It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the 
reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, 
you remember?" 

Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he 
had just hitch-hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead 
Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding 
reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it 
would only confuse matters further. 

"No," he said. 

"That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a cafe 
somewhere. Rickmansworth. Don't know what she was doing there, 
but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly 
announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or 



something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed 
screaming into an egg sandwich." 

Arthur winced. "I'm very sorry to hear that," he said a little stiffly. 

Russell made a sort of grumping noise. 

"So what," said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, "was 
the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?" 

"Bobbing up and down of course. He was dead." 

"But what..." 

"Come on, you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations. 

Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into drug 
warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of invading 
a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make 
everyone think they'd been invaded." 

"What hallucinations were those exactly...?" said Arthur in a rather 
quiet voice. 

"What do you mean, what hallucinations? I'm talking about all that 
stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we're 
going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off. The 
CIA denied it which meant it must be true." 

Arthur's head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something 
to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little 
opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say 
something, but nothing emerged. 

"Anyway," continued Russell, "whatever drug it was it didn't seem 
to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer 
friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum 
with a banana, so..." He shrugged. 

"The Vogon..." squeaked Arthur. "The yellow ships... vanished?" 

"Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations," said Russell, 
and looked at Arthur oddly. "You trying to say you don't remember 
any of this? Where have you been for heaven's sake?" 

This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he 
half-leapt out of his seat with shock. 

"Christ!!!" yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was 
suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming 
lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt. 



the girl in the back was thrown against Russell's seat and collapsed 
awkwardly. 

Arthur twisted round in horror. 

"Is she all right?" he blurted out. 

Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair. 
He tugged at his blond moustache. He turned to Arthur. 

"Would you please," he said, "let go of the handbrake?" 



Chapter 6 


From here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a further mile to 
the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely 
declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding 
country lane. 

The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as 
stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally 
blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been 
wearing too large a hat. 

He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some 
salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an 
otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if 
there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, 
hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful 
blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if 
not his sanity. 

It was 10.30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the 
steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which 
there had hung for many years a battered old Guiness clock which 
featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather 
amusingly down its throat. 

This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime 
during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had been 
demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn it, 
had been demolished, because if it hadn't then where the bloody 
heck had he been for the last eight years, and how he had got there if 
not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell 
had just been telling him were merely drug-induced hallucinations, 
and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing 
on...? 



He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn't 
going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he'd 
been over it. 

He started again. 

This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime 
during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort 
out later had happened, and... 

It still didn't make sense. 

He started again. 

This was the pub in which... 

This was a pub. 

Pubs served drinks and he couldn't half do with one. 

Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a 
conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn't the 
one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door. 

And stopped. 

A small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall 
and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl. 

Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an 
advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing-Bozo because 
the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people of the 
President of the United States, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least 
should do. It was a stupid dog, could not even read an autocue, which 
way why some people had protested about its name, but it should at 
least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, 
hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to 
intrude upon its feeble-witted life. 

This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this 
time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself. 

Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he 
had to admit that the dog had a point. 

He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds 
with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his 
present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind, and 
worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the 
moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard 



him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill-equipped to deal 
with. 

Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing-Bozo the 
Non-Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from 
one of Will's own commercials for being incapable of knowing which 
dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in 
all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it. 

Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, here was his car, 
a grey Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read, "My 
other car is also a Porsche." Damn him. 

He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he 
hadn't known before. 

Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under-scrupulous 
bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car 
every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do 
it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop 
him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on - and this was 
the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number 
plate proclaimed its year. 

Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused 
Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred 
at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could 
have passed here. 

He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know-Nothing-Bozo 
jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a 
realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an 
alien on his own world. Try as he might, no one was even to be able 
to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was 
flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts. 

Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he 
had made some extraordinary mistake? 

The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every 
detail - every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could 
sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its 
unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people 
he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of 
girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all 
the stuff of his home, his world. 



He even knew this blasted dog. 

"Hey, Know-Nothing!" 

The sound of Will Smithers' voice meant he had to decide what do 
to quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the 
whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, 
and it was bitterly cold now. 

The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn't that 
Arthur disliked him as such-Will was quite fun. It was just that he was 
fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he 
always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where 
he had got his jacket from. 

Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van. 

"Hey, Know-Nothing, what's up?" 

The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket 
that he'd got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a 
car into specially, in order to get that battered look. Know-Nothing 
yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was 
happy to forget Arthur. 

Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with 
the dog. 

"Commies!" they all shouted at the dog in chorus. "Commies, 
commies, commies!!!" 

The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping 
its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all 
laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various 
cars and disappeared into the night. 

Well that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van, 
this is quite definitely the planet I remember. 



Chapter 7 


His house was still there. 

How or why, he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look 
while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and 
ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone. 
And there it was. 

He hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone frog 
in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing. 

He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to 
run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from. 

The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing 
accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on 
what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally 
addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, 
seventeen identical threatening letters for non-payment of bills on a 
credit card he didn't have, thirty-three identical letters saying that he 
personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and 
discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in 
today's sophisticated jet-setting world and would he therefore like to 
buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten. 

He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded 
by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no 
discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap 
of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom 
and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing. 

He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty-smelling bed and for a 
few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round 
his head in the way it obviously wanted to. 

When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, 
Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on. 
To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur's sense of logic. Since 
the Electricity Board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill. 



it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected 
when he didn't. Sending them money obviously only drew attention 
to yourself. 

The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy, though 
the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half-read books 
and magazines nestled amongst piles of half-used towels. Half pairs of 
socks reclined in half-drunk cups of coffee. What was once a half- 
eaten sandwich had now half-turned into something that Arthur 
entirely didn't want to know about. Bung a fork of lightning through 
this lot, he thought to himself, and you'd start the evolution of life all 
over again. 

There was only one thing in the room that was different. 

For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one thing that was 
different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. 
Then his eyes caught it and stopped. 

It was next to a battered old television on which it was only 
possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to 
show anything more exciting it would break down. 

It was a box. 

Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it. 

It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a cubic grey 
box, just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, 
knotted into a neat bow on the top. 

He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was 
clearly gift-wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him 
to open it. 

Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He 
brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the 
box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box. 

He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, 
nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn't a 
proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur 
realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A 
fish bowl. 

It was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent, yet 
with an extraordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and slate had 
gone into its making. 



Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the 
most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely 
perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue 
paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing. 

He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was exquisite. 
But it was a fish bowl. 

He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and 
glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, 
and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into 
other worlds, as into a deep sea dream. 

Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light 
from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and 
glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl's surface. He held it 
up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the 
finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass. 

"So Long," they said, "and Thanks..." 

And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing. 

For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, 
held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing 
chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could 
find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap 
and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little 
Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He 
wouldn't be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies. 

He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light. 

He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly 
relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, 
gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes and was 
completely incapable of getting to sleep. 

The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had 
now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a 
small transport cafe just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through 
which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a 
damply ruffled air, as if it didn't know what else it might not do it 
further provoked. 



The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper 
from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing 
machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old 
shopping list or a five pound note. 

The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's trying to 
decide what sort of mood it's in tonight, and a bell somewhere 
chimed midnight. 

A skylight creaked open. 

It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the 
frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life 
been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open. 

A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the 
narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof. 

It stood and watched the sky in silence. 

The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild-looking 
creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour 
ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with 
the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from 
a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone 
the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all. 

Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in 
corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, 
his chin clean shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the 
Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to 
stop. 

They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at 
this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the 
eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery 
involved, just the continual wrenching of experience. 

The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the 
dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted. 

He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far 
river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked 
somewhere away to the south. 

He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something 
he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the 
earth, but he'd never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He 



could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him 
all the way from the New Forest. He must try this summer, he thought, 
and see what having leaves felt like. 

From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep 
startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from 
the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever 
encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their 
journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the 
morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields. 

He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by 
the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a 
clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further 
back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being 
startled by things they'd been startled by the day before. 

He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in 
developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of 
them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly 
excited, one fractured. 

One fractured. 

He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded 
him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism. He felt a 
spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at 
least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it 
is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you 
to know that it is. 

He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find 
her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he could feel he 
was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let 
his mind wander more easily once more. 

And again, he felt the fracture. 

Again he couldn't find it. This time, whatever his instinct was busy 
telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn't certain that it was 
Fenny - or perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the 
same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of 
fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was 
different. 



He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, 
seeping, sinking. 

He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the 
rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, 
swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture 
kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache. 

And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, 
the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the 
second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the 
thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of 
Earth. 

And suddenly he was upon it. 

He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer 
away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly 
twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, 
falling. 

Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an 
older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths. He 
woke. 

A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. 
The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders 
dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last 
he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant 
anything at all, he would think about it in the morning; for now he 
would go to bed and sleep. His own bed, his own sleep. 

He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. 

It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather 
dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was 
about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours, 
John Ainsworth. His rose bushes were carefully tended, pruned back 
for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered 
what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him 
there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he 
crashed awkwardly to the ground. 

He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to 
his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed. 



While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen 
minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood 
a chance of waking him up. 

Chapter 8 


Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, 
overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at 
all to discover it was the middle of February. 

He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things 
in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes. 
Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them 
breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space 
disease he's picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas 
Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half 
the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half 
and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky 
there. 

He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk 
mail with a spade and then buried the cat. 

Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring 
while he maintained a moment's respectful silence. Whoever it was 
would ring back if it was important. 

He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside. 

There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of 
junk - some documents from the council, dated three years earlier, 
relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other 
letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass 
scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the 
ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made 
contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins 
and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends, vaguely 
complaining that he never got in touch these days. 



He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which 
he marked "Things To Do". Since he was feeling so vigorous and 
dynamic that morning, he even added the word "Urgent!" 

He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from 
the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market. The 
slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri 
which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and 
therefore entirely pointless for a Duty Free Shop at a spaceport. The 
bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away. 

He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have 
dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, 
kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303. He had 
lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped 
him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had 
traversed. He had lost the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

Well, he told himself, this time I really won't be needing it again. 

He had some calls to make. 

He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his 
return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it 
out. 

He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department 
head. 

"Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven't been in for six 
months but I've gone mad." 

"Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that. 
Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?" 

"When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?" 

"Sometime in spring I think." 

"I'll be in shortly after that." 

"Rightyho." 

He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of 
numbers to try. 

"Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to 
see if I could have a word with Fenella, er... Fenella - Good Lord, silly 
me, I'll forget my own name next, er, Fenella - isn't this ridiculous? 
Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last night..." 



"I'm afraid we don't have any patients called Fenella." 

"Oh, don't you? I mean Fiona of course, we just call her Fen..." 

"I'm sorry, goodbye." 

Click. 

Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his 
mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it 
deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it 
a little. 

Fie had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable 
weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he 
pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night. 

"Arthur!!!!" 

Fie grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from 
all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he'd 
had in Southern California. 



Chapter 9 


He accepted another pint and took a pull at it. 

"Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too." 

"You what?" 

He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and 
Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the 
first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at 
which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the 
point at which he started instead to get inventive. 

"Oh yes," he insisted with a happy glazed smile. "It's why I've lost 
so much weight." 

"What?" said his audience. 

"Oh yes," he said again. "The Californians have rediscovered 
alchemy. Oh yes." 

He smiled again. 

"Only," he said, "it's in a much more useful form than that which 
in..." He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his 
head. "In which the ancients used to practise it. Or at least," he added, 
"failed to practise it. They couldn't get it to work you know. 
Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn't cut it." 

"Nostradamus?" said one of his audience. 

"I didn't think he was an alchemist," said another. 

"I thought," said a third, "he was a seer." 

"He became a seer," said Arthur to his audience, the component 
parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, "because he 
was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that." 

He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not 
tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it. 

"What has alchemy got to do," asked a bit of the audience, "with 
losing weight?" 



"I'm glad you asked that," said Arthur. "Very glad. And I will now 
tell you what the connection is between..." He paused. "Between 
those two things. The things you mentioned. I'll tell you." 

He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil 
tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel. 

"They've discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold," he said, 
in a sudden blur of coherence. 

"You’re kidding." 

"Oh yes," he said, "no," he corrected himself, "they have." 

He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of 
it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely. 

"Have you been to California?" he demanded. "Do you know the 
sort of stuff they do there?" 

Three members of his audience said they had and that he was 
talking nonsense. 

"You haven't seen anything," insisted Arthur. "Oh yes," he added, 
because someone was offering to buy another round. 

"The evidence," he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by 
more than a couple of inches, "is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in 
a trance," he said, "in a tank. In a trance. I was in a tank. I think," he 
added after a thoughtful pause, "I already said that." 

He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He 
composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be 
something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line 
dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline drawn 
between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when 
he decided to give it a miss. 

"Long time," he said instead, "in a tank. In a trance." He looked 
round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following 
attentively. 

He resumed. 

"Where was I?" he said. 

"In a trance," said one. 

"In a tank," said another. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur. "Thank you. And slowly," he said pressing 
onwards, "slowly, slowly, all your excess body fat... turns... to..." he 



paused for effect, "subcoo... subyoo... subtoocay..." - he paused for 
breath - "subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. 
Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say?" 

"I was just clearing my throat." 

"I think you doubt me." 

"I was clearing my throat." 

"She was clearing her throat," confirmed a significant part of the 
audience in a low rumble. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "all right. And you then split the proceeds..." 
he paused again for a maths break, "fifty-fifty with the alchemist. 
Make a lot of money!" 

He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but 
be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces. 

He felt very affronted by this. 

"How else," he demanded, "could I afford to have my face 
dropped?" 

Friendly arms began to help him home. "Listen," he protested, as 
the cold February breeze brushed his face, "looking lived-in is all the 
rage in California at the moment. You've got to look as if you've seen 
the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You've got to look as if you've seen life. 

That's what I got. A face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being 
thirty doesn't come back into fashion or I've wasted a lot of money." 

He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to 
help him along the lane to his house. 

"Got in yesterday," he mumbled. "I'm very happy to be home. Or 
somewhere very like it..." 

"Jet lag," muttered one of his friends. "Long trip from California. 
Really mucks you up for a couple of days." 

"I don't think he's been there at all," muttered another. "I wonder 
where he has been. And what's happened to him." 

After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a 
bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He 
wondered how he was going to find Fenny. 

He sat and looked at the fish bowl. He tapped it again, and despite 
being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its 



way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant 
chime as clearly and mesmerically as before. 

Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He 
wondered who, and for what. 



Chapter 10 


"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and twenty 
seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized 
that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked 
laugh. 

He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub-Etha Net to 
the ship's hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing-song voice 
spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and thirty seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye 
on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship's computer display. 
For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power 
consumption became significant. He didn't want a murder on his 
conscience. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and forty seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short 
corridor. "At the third stroke..." 

He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel 
bathroom. 

"it will be..." 

It sounded fine in there. 

He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters. 

"... one... thirty-two..." 

It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of 
the speakers. He took down the towel. 


"... and fifty seconds." 



Fine. 

He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn't at all satisfied 
with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the 
way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke 
open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn't 
know why he hadn't thought of that before. A whooshing rumbling 
noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could 
be heard again. 

It stopped. 

He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door 
again on the now empty cargo hold. 

"... one... thirty-three... and fifty seconds." 

Very nice. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He then went and had a last thorough examination of the 
emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he 
particularly wanted it to be heard. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty... four... precisely." 

He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted 
covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, 
it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not 
exactly local time, true, but what the heck. 

He double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed, 
dimmed the lights and checked it again. 

"At the third stroke it will be..." 

He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin. 

"... one... thirty-four and twenty seconds." 

The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in 
London, which he wasn't, not by a long way. 

He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a brilliant 
biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was Zondostina, or as it 
was known on the world from which the rather stilted, sing-song 
voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta. 

The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the 
giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian battleships 



docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, 
Epun. 

"At the third stroke it will be..." 

For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the 
ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the 
numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close 
the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. 

"One... fifty-nine..." 

His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and 
radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible 
unless you were actually looking at it, but then he'd had an idea he 
preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil-thin, 
broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal's 
origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at 
light speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir 
when it did. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He sniggered. 

He didn't like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled 
or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and 
sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now. 

"At the third stroke..." 

The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit 
round a little known and never visited moon. Almost perfect. 

One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of 
the launching of the ship's little Escape-O-Buggy, balancing actions, 
reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, 
and saw that it was good. 

Before he left, he turned out the lights. 

As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the 
beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port 
Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of 
radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still. 

"At the third stroke, it will be two... thirteen... and fifty seconds." 

He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he 
didn't have the room. 



"Beep... beep... beep." 



Chapter 11 


"April showers I hate especially." 

However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed 
determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move 
to another table, but there didn't seem to be one free in the whole 
cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely. 

"Bloody April showers. Hate hate hate." 

Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray of 
rain hung over the motorway. Two months he'd been back now. 
Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People 
had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of 
crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to him not so much 
like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the tv and now 
kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch. 

One effect that still lingered though, was his joy at being back. Now 
that the Earth's atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he 
thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary 
pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had 
to protest. 

"Well, I like them," he said suddenly, "and for all the obvious 
reasons. They're light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel 
good." 

The man snorted derisively. 

"That's what they all say," he said, and glowered darkly from his 
corner seat. 

He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening, 
unprovoked remark had been, "I'm a lorry driver. I hate driving in the 
rain. Ironic isn't it? Bloody ironic." 

If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been 
able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not 
encouraging. 



But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred 
now. "They all say that about bloody April showers," he said. "So 
bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather." 

He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say 
something about the government. 

"What I want to know is this," he said, "if it's going to be nice 
weather, why," he almost spat, "can't it be nice without bloody 
raining?" 

Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot 
to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold. 

"Well, there you go," he said and instead got up himself. "Bye." 

He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back 
through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain 
on his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening 
over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that too. 

He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi, 
squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps 
and on to the slip road back towards the motorway. 

He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had 
closed finally and for ever above his head. 

He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind 
him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels 
had dragged him. 

He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, 
dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on 
a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe. 

He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things. 

The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a 
small umbrella. 

His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and 
skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over. 

"Fenny!" he shouted. 

Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her 
instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her. 

It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then 
bowled wildly away across the road. 



"Shit!" yelled Arthur as helpfully as he cold, leapt out of his own 
door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKeena's All-Weather 
Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny's umbrella 
instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away. 

The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs, expiring 
sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little. 

He picked it up. 

"Er," he said. There didn't seem to be a lot of point in offering the 
thing back to her. 

"How did you know my name?" she said. 

"Er, well," he said. "Look, I'll get you another one..." 

He looked at her and tailed off. 

She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and 
serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a 
statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. 

She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked 
as if she was looking at. 

But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly 
arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, and 
impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very 
disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell. 

She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into 
the front seat. 

"Don't worry about the umbrella," she said to him as she climbed 
in. "It was my brother's and he can't have liked it or he wouldn't have 
given it to me." She laughed and pulled on her seatbelt. "You're not a 
friend of my brother's are you?" 

"No." 

Her voice was the only part of her which didn't say "Good". 

Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite 
extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, 
that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these 
functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble. 

So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother's car, the 
night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare 
years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it 
had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable 



to fall off whatever it is that well-balanced people are supposed to be 
balancing on. 

"So..." he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting 
start. 

"He was meant to pick me up - my brother - but phoned to say he 
couldn't make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look at 
the calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch. So." 

"So." 

"So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my 
name." 

"Perhaps we ought to first sort out," said Arthur, looking back over 
his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, "where I'm 
taking you." 

Very close, he hoped, or long away. Close would mean she lived 
near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there. 

"I'd like to go to Taunton," she said, "please. If that's all right. It's 
not far. You can drop me at..." 

"You live in Taunton?" he said, hoping that he'd managed to sound 
merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to 
him. He could... 

"No, London," she said. "There's a train in just under an hour." 

It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up 
the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering 
with horror heard himself saying, "Oh, I can take you to London. Let 
me take you to London..." 

Bungling idiot. Why on Earth had he said "let" in that stupid way? 
He was behaving like a twelve-year-old. 

"Are you going to London?" she asked. 

"I wasn't," he said, "but..." Bungling idiot. 

"It's very kind of you," she said, "but really no. I like to go by train." 
And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her which brought 
her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out of the window 
and hummed lightly to herself. 

He couldn't believe it. 

Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he'd blown it. 



Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of 
accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not 
behave like this. 

Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost. 

He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was 
going to have to do something dramatic. 

"Fenny," he said. 

She glanced round sharply at him. 

"You still haven't told me how..." 

"Listen," said Arthur, "I will tell you, though the story is rather 
strange. Very strange." 

She was still looking at him, but said nothing. 

"Listen..." 

"You said that." 

"Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things I 
must tell you... a story I must tell you which would..." He was 
thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of "Thy 
knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular quill to stand 
on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine" but didn't think he 
could carry it off and didn't like the hedgehog reference. 

"... which would take more than five miles," he settled for in the 
end, rather lamely he was afraid. 

"Well..." 

"Just supposing," he said, "just supposing" - he didn't know what 
was coming next, so he thought he'd just sit back and listen - "that 
there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important 
to me, and that, though you didn't know it, I was very important to 
you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I 
was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to 
someone I've only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, 
what would you say..." he paused helplessly, and looked at her, "I... 
should do?" 

"Watch the road!" she yelped. 

"Shit!" 

He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian 
washing machines in a German lorry. 



"I think," she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, "you should buy 
me a drink before my train goes." 



Chapter 12 


There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs 
near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of 
pallor to the pork pies. 

Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. 

There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich 
interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something 
sinful that only foreigners do. 

"Make 'em dry," is the instruction buried somewhere in the 
collective national consciousness, "make 'em rubbery. If you have to 
keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing 'em once a week." 

It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the 
British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. 
They're not altogether clear what those sins are, and don't want to 
know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. 
But whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for by the 
sandwiches they make themselves eat. 

If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages 
which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of 
something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef's 
hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and 
died, forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in Stepney. 

The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and 
wish to atone for something specific. 

"There must be somewhere better," said Arthur. 

"No time," said Fenny, glancing at her watch. "My train leaves in 
half an hour." 

They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses, and 
some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenny a 
tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it. And a 
couple of sausages. Fie didn't know why. Fie bought them for 
something to do while the gas settled in his glass. 



The barman dunked Arthur's change in a pool of beer on the bar, 
for which Arthur thanked him. 

"All right," said Fenny, glancing at her watch, "tell me what it is you 
have to tell me." 

She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur's 
heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conductive setting to try to 
explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a 
sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the 
mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the 
fact that, appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding, the Earth had 
been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, 
something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having 
virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore 
both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to 
got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible. 

"Fenny," he started. 

"I wonder if you'd like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It's just a 
little one." 

He glanced up sharply. 

"To raise money for Anjie who's retiring." 

"What?" 

"And needs a kidney machine." 

He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged woman 
with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile 
that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot. 

She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a 
collecting tin. 

"Only ten pence each," she said, "so you could probably even buy 
two. Without breaking the bank!" She gave a tinkly little laugh and 
then a curiously long sigh. Saying "Without breaking the bank" had 
obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some GIs had 
been billeted on her in the war. 

"Er, yes, all right," said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and 
producing a couple of coins. 

With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such 
a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur. 



"I do hope you win," she said with a smile that suddenly snapped 
together like a piece of advanced origami, "the prizes are so nice." 

"Yes, thank you," said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather 
brusquely and glancing at his watch. 

He turned towards Fenny. 

So did the woman with the raffle tickets. 

"And what about you, young lady?" she said. "It's for Anjie's kidney 
machine. She's retiring you see. Yes?" She hoisted the little smile even 
further up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon or the 
skin would surely split. 

"Er, look, here you are," said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece 
at her in the hope that that would see her off. 

"Oh, we are in the money, aren't we?" said the woman, with a long 
smiling sigh. "Down from London are we?" 

"No, that's all right, really," he said with a wave of his hand, and 
she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by 
one. 

"Oh, but you must have your tickets," insisted the woman, "or you 
won't be able to claim your prize. They're very nice prizes, you know. 
Very suitable." 

Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he 
could. 

The woman turned to Fenny once again. 

"And now, what about..." 

"No!" Arthur nearly yelled. "These are for her," he explained, 
brandishing the five new tickets. 

"Oh, I see! How nice!" 

She smiled sickeningly at both of them. 

"Well, I do hope you..." 

"Yes," snapped Arthur, "thank you." 

The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur 
turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was 
rocking with silent laughter. 

He sighed and smiled. 

"Where were we?" 

"You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to." 



"What do you mean?" 

She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice. 

"It's why I asked if you were a friend of my brother's. Or half- 
brother really. He's the only one who calls me Fenny, and I'm not fond 
of him for it." 

"So what's...?" 

"Fenchurch." 

"What?" 

"Fenchurch." 

"Fenchurch." 

She looked at him sternly. 

"Yes," she said, "and I'm watching you like a lynx to see if you're 
going to ask the same silly question that everybody asks me until I 
want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall 
scream. So watch it." 

She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered 
at him from behind it. 

"Oh," he said, "that's a little unfair, isn't it?" 

"Yes." 

"Fine." 

"All right," she said with a laugh, "you can ask me. Might as well get 
it over with. Better than have you call me Fenny all the time." 

"Presumably..." said Arthur. 

"We've only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so 
generous when I spoke to you before..." 

"What?" snapped Arthur. 

The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty 
book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under 
his nose. 

"I thought I'd give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so 
nice." 

She wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially. 

"Very tasteful. I know you'll like them. And it is for Anjie's 
retirement present you see. We want to give her..." 

"A kidney machine, yes," said Arthur. "Here." 



He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets. 

A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. 

You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach. 

"Oh dear," she said, "I'm not interrupting anything am I?" 

She peered anxiously at both of them. 

"No it's fine," said Arthur. Everything that could possibly be fine," 
he insisted, "is fine. 

"Thank you," he added. 

"I say," she said, in a delightful ecstacy of worry, "you're not... in 
love, are you?" 

"It's very hard to say," said Arthur. "We haven't had a chance to 
talk yet." 

He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning. 

The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality. 

"I'll let you see the prizes in a minute," she said, and left. 

Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to 
say whether he was in love with. 

"You were about to ask me," she said, "a question." 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"We can do it together if you like," said Fenchurch. "Was I 
found ..." 

"... in a handbag..." joined in Arthur. 

"... in the Left Luggage Office..." they said together. 

"... at Fenchurch street station," they finished. 

"And the answer," said Fenchurch, "is no." 

"Fine," said Arthur. 

"I was conceived there." 

"What?" 

"I was con - " 

"In the Left Luggage Office?" hooted Arthur. 

"No, of course not. Don't be silly. What would my parents be doing 
in the Left Luggage Office?" she said, rather taken aback by the 
suggestion. 

"Well, I don't know," spluttered Arthur, "or rather..." 

"It was in the ticket queue." 



"The..." 

"The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They 
only say you wouldn't believe how bored it is possible to get in the 
ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station." 

She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch. 

Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two. 

"I'm going to have to go in a minute or two," said Fenchurch, "and 
you haven't begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary 
thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest." 

"Why don't you let me drive you to London?" said Arthur. "It's 
Saturday, I've got nothing particular to do, I'd..." 

"No," said Fenchurch, "thank you, it's sweet of you, but no. I need 
to be by myself for a couple of days." She smiled and shrugged. 

"But..." 

"You can tell me another time. I'll give you my number." 

Arthur's heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled 
seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him. 

"Now we can relax," she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur 
till he thought he would burst. 

"Fenchurch," he said, enjoying the name as he said it. "I - " 

"A box," said a trailing voice, "of cherry liqueurs, and also, and I 
know you'll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe 
music..." 

"Yes thank you, very nice," insisted Arthur. 

"I just thought I'd let you have a look at them," said the permed 
woman, "as you're down from London..." 

She was holding them out proudly for Arthur too see. He could see 
that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of 
bagpipe music. That was what they were. 

"I'll let you have your drink in peace now," she said, patting Arthur 
lightly on his seething shoulder, "but I knew you'd like to see." 

Arthur re-engaged his eyes with Fenchurch's once again, and 
suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and 
gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been 
wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman. 



"Don't worry," said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over 
the top of her glass, "we will talk again." She took a sip. 

"Perhaps," she added, "it wouldn't have gone so well if it wasn't for 
her." She gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair forward over 
her face again. 

It was perfectly true. 

He had to admit it was perfectly true. 



Chapter 13 


That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house 
pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and 
continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could 
even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was 
eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to 
listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should 
even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or 
next week sometime. 

No. No games. He wanted her and didn't care who knew it. He 
definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, 
wanted to do more things than there were names for with her. 

He actually caught himself saying thinks like "Yippee" as he prances 
ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her voice, 
everything... 

He stopped. 

He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call 
her. 

Would he, perhaps, call her first? 

No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of 
bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it. 
Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was what he 
would do. 

He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when 
he did so. 

He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out of its 
cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp. They both 
survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc. 

He sat and listened solemnly to "A Scottish Soldier". 

He listened to "Amazing Grace". 

He listened to something about some glen or other. 



He thought about his miraculous lunchtime. 

They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were 
distracted by an awful outbreak of "yoo-hooing". The appallingly 
permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid 
bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and 
seemed to be expecting some sort of response. 

They hadn't listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie 
was going to be about the 4.30p everyone had helped to raise 
towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that 
someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, 
and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo- 
hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37. 

Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch. 

Fenchurch gave him a push. 

"Go on," she said, "go and get it. Don't be bad tempered. Give 
them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a 
call and tell me how it went. I'll want to hear the record. Go on." 

She flicked his arm and left. 

The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over-effusive. It 
was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music. 

Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on 
breaking into laughter. 



Chapter 14 


Ring ring. 

Ring ring. 

Ring ring. 

"Hello, yes? Yes, that's right. Yes. You'll 'ave to speak up, there's an 
awful lot of noise in 'ere. What? 

"No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It's Yvonne who does lunch, 
and Jim, he's the landlord. No, I wasn't on. What? 

"You'll have to speak up. 

"What? No, don't know anything about no raffle. What? 

"No, don't know nothing about it. 'Old on. I'll call Jim." 

The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the 
noisy bar. 

"'Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he's won a 
raffle. He keeps on saying it's ticket 37 and he's won." 

"No, there was a guy in the pub here won," shouted back the 
barman. 

"He says 'ave we got the ticket." 

"Well how can he think he's won if he hasn't even got a ticket?" 

"Jim says 'ow can you think you've won if you 'aven't even got the 
ticket. What?" 

She put her hand over the receiver again. 

"Jim, 'e keeps effing and blinding at me. Says there's a number on 
the ticket." 

"Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle 
ticket wasn't it?" 

"'E says 'e means its a telephone number on the ticket." 

"Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?" 



Chapter 15 


Eight hours West sat a man alone on a beach mourning an 
inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of 
grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne. 

He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, 
and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to 
happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn't happen 
and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath 
the long line of sea, and the day was gone. 

The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private 
house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along 
the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los 
Angeles, which is described in the new edition of the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as "junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and 
what's that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo", and in 
another, written only hours later as "being like several thousand 
square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same 
sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow." 

The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay 
of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a "good place to go. 

It's very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space 
traveller. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying 'hi'. 
Until you've settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say 
'no' to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, 
because there are some very strange things going on there, some of 
which an unsuspecting alien could die of." The hundreds of curling 
miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are 
described in the Guide as "Boffo. A good one." 

And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the 
house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being 
insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was. 



One of the many reasons why people thought him insane was 
because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where 
most people's houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite 
extreme in his peculiarness. 

His house was called The Outside of the Asylum. 

His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be 
called - and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this - 
Wonko the Sane. 

In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass 
bowl with eight words engraved upon it. 

We can talk of him much later on - this is just an interlude to watch 
the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it. 

He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting 
for the end of the world - little realizing that it had already been and 
gone. 



Chapter 16 


After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a 
pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone 
number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the 
more things he tried, the more weeks passed. 

He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world 
and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in 
the motorway service station cafeteria where he'd been just before 
he met her. 

"It's the drizzle that makes me particularly morose." 

"Please shut up about the drizzle," snapped Arthur. 

"I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling." 

"Look..." 

"But I'll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?" 

"No." 

"Blatter." 

"What?" 

"It will blatter." 

Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside 
world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he 
had been driven there by superstition rather than logic. However, as if 
to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact 
happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had 
encountered there last time. 

The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being 
dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man's exasperating 
conversation. 

"I think," said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to 
say this, "that it's easing off." 

"Ha!" 



Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That's what he should do. He 
should just go. 

"It never stops raining!" ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the 
table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be 
steaming. 

You can't just walk off without responding to a remark like that. 

"Of course it stops raining," said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant 
refutation, but it had to be said. 

"It rains... all... the time," raved the man, thumping the table again, 
in time to the words. 

Arthur shook his head. 

"Stupid to say it rains all the time..." he said. 

The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted. 

"Stupid? Why's it stupid? Why's it stupid to say it rains all the time 
if it rains the whole time?" 

"Didn't rain yesterday." 

"Did in Darlington." 

Arthur paused, warily. 

"You going to ask me where I was yesterday?" asked the man. 

"Eh?" 

"No," said Arthur. 

"But I expect you can guess." 

"Do you." 

"Begins with a D." 

"Does it." 

"And it was pissing down there, I can tell you." 

"You don't want to sit there, mate," said a passing stranger in 
overalls to Arthur cheerily. "That's Thundercloud Corner that is. 
Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here. 
There's one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny 
Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. 'Swhat we all do. How's it going, 
Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tyres on? Har har." 

He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to 
someone at a nearby table. 



"See, none of them bastards take me seriously," said Rob McKeena. 
"But," he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, 
"they all know it's true!" 

Arthur frowned. 

"Like my wife," hissed the sole owner and driver of McKeena's All- 
Weather Haulage. "She says it's nonsense and I make a fuss and 
complain about nothing, but," he paused dramatically and darted out 
dangerous looks from his eyes, "she always brings the washing in 
when I phone to say I'm on me way home!" He brandished his coffee 
spoon. "What do you make of that?" 

"Well..." 

"I have a book," he went on, "I have a book. A diary. Kept it for 
fifteen years. Shows every single place I've ever been. Every day. And 
also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly," he snarled, 
"'orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I been. All round the 
Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to 
Yugoslavia. It's all marked in and charted. Even when I went to visit 
my brother," he added, "in Seattle." 

"Well," said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, "perhaps you'd 
better show it to someone." 

"I will," said Rob McKeena. 

And he did. 



Chapter 17 


Misery, dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a 
project and he gave himself one. 

He would find where his cave had been. 

On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a lousy 
cave, but... There was no but. It had been a totally lousy cave and he 
had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years which made it home 
of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur 
Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer. 

That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he felt 
he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply 
went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise 
mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious 
purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth. 
He explained this to the man in the shop. 

"Why?" said the man in the shop. 

This was a tricky one. 

"OK, skip that," said the man in the shop. "How?" 

"Well, I was hoping you could help me with that." 

The man sighed and his shoulders dropped. 

"Have you much experience of computers?" 

Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard 
computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a 
second, or Deep Thought, or - but decided he wouldn't. 

"No," he said. 

"Looks like a fun afternoon," said the man in the shop, but he said 
it only to himself. 

Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired 
some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew 
rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to 
have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and 



worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the 
conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was 
that the whole project was completely ludicrous. 

Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn't even know 
how long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect's rough guess at the time 
that it was "a couple of million years" and he simply didn't have the 
maths. 

Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least 
produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the 
extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and 
arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right 
galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result. 

He would call it the right result. Who would know? 

As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of 
fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know 
that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door. 

"Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first." 

Arthur gaped in astonishment. 

"You can only come in for a few minutes," said Fenchurch. "I'm just 
going out." 



Chapter 18 


A summer's day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique¬ 
restoring machinery. 

Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur 
wandered in a blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops which, in 
Islington, are quite an useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs 
old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture or 
fish will readily confirm. 

The sun beat down over the roofgardens. It beat on architects and 
plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas. It beat 
on estate agent's particulars. 

It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop. 

"It's an interesting building," said the proprietor, cheerfully. 

"There's a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby 
pub. It was built for the Prince Regent apparently, so he could make 
his escape when he needed to." 

"You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine 
furniture," said Arthur 

"No," said the proprietor, "not for that reason." 

"You'll have to excuse me," said Arthur. "I'm terribly happy." 

"I see." 

He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of 
Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file marked "Things 
to do-urgent!", which he hadn't opened again in the meantime. He 
marched in with a cheery smile and said he'd come to give them some 
money to help free the dolphins. 

"Very funny," they told him, "go away." 

This wasn't quite the response he had expected, so he tried again. 
This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money 
anyway and went back out into the sunshine. 



Just after six he returned to Fenchurch's house in the alleyway, 
clutching a bottle of champagne. 

"Hold this," she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and 
disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which 
dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar. 

The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial 
alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As 
well as its large stable doors it also had a normal-looking front door of 
smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker. The 
one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet 
high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and 
presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses. 

An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it 
was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other 
end of the rope held a suspended 'cello. 

The door opened above his head. 

"OK," said Fenchurch, "pull on the rope, steady the 'cello. Pass it up 
to me." 

He pulled on the rope, he steadied the 'cello. 

"I can't pull on the rope again," he said, "without letting go of the 
’cello." 

Fenchurch leant down. 

"I'm steadying the ’cello," she said. "You pull on the rope." 

The 'cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and 
Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside. 

"Come on up yourself," she called down. 

Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable 
doors, tingling. 

The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty 
rough and full of junk. A large old cast-iron mangle stood there, a 
surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was 
also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very 
old and uncomplicatedly full of books. 

The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this was 
the measure of Arthur's mood as he stared up the rickety wooden 
steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him 
an almost unbearably sensual thing. 



"An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do 
wonderful things with this place," said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur 
emerged through the floor. "He keeps on coming round, standing in 
stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events 
and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and 
disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have, therefore, so far failed 
to happen to it." 

In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at 
least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, 
furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with 
speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up 
Stonehenge. 

There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were 
interesting. 

There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a 
bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could 
actually swing a cat in. "But," she added, "only if it was a reasonably 
patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So. 
Here you are." 

"Yes." 

They looked at each other for a moment. 

The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very 
long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was 
coming from. 

For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left 
alone for long enough with a Swiss Cheese plant, the moment was 
one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and 
zoo-born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage 
hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to 
the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking. 

He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly 
wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise. 

He hadn't realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that 
brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had 
never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said 
something it had never said to him before, which was "Yes". 



Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her 
head. 

"I know," she said. "I shall have to remember," she added, "that 
you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of 
paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it." 

She turned away. 

"Let's go for a walk," she said quickly. "Hyde Park. I'll change into 
something less suitable." 

She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly 
shapely one, and it didn't really suit her. 

"I wear it specially for my 'cello teacher," she said. "He's a nice boy, 
but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I'll be 
down in a moment." 

She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, 
"Put the bottle in the fridge for later." 

He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it 
had an identical twin to sit next to. 

He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and 
started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her 
dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person 
he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he 
would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the 
spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the 
blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down. 

This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do. 

She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed 
hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she 
shook her head, dropped the light sundress over herself and 
disappeared quickly into the bathroom. 

She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and 
came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a 
strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it 
and put her head slightly on one side. 

"Like it?" she said. 

"You look gorgeous," he said simply, because she did. 

"Hmmmm," she said, as if he hadn't really answered her question. 



She closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this 
time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit 
state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur's eyes followed hers 
around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped 
something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying. 

Arthur looked back at her. 

"Ready?" 

"Did you know," she said with a slightly puzzled smile, "that there's 
something wrong with me?" 

Her directness caught Arthur unprepared. 

"Well," he said, "I'd heard some vague sort of..." 

"I wonder how much you do know about me," she said. "I you 
heard it from where I think you heard then that's not it. Russell just 
sort of makes stuff up, because he can't deal with what it really is." 

A pang of worry went through Arthur. 

"Then what is it?" he said. "Can you tell me?" 

"Don't worry," she said, "it's nothing bad at all. Just unusual. Very 
very unusual." 

She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him 
briefly. 

"I shall be very interested to know," she said, "if you manage to 
work out what it is this evening." 

Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have 
chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made 
when he flicked it with his thumbnail. 



Chapter 19 


Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound 
of gunfire. 

He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had 
fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier 
machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels. He slung himself 
down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 

They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was 
continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that 
through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming 
noises. 

That wasn't it, though. 

He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that 
looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim 
corridor with a nasty searing screech. 

That wasn't it either. 

He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself 
in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit. 

The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was 
heavier. A small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible 
clattering. 

Still not it, though. 

Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he 
walked along it in the other direction. 

He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls 
behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 

One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure 
ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It was 
hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very 
strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down. 

That wasn't it, though. 



He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some 
brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you 
used it. There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasn't it. 

He came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that 
was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship. 

As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot 
starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, 
silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the ship 
simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously 
incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them. 

That was it. 

Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on 
the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been 
burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on. 

He yawned and dug his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flicked idly through 
some level three entries and some level four entries. He was looking 
for some good insomnia cures. He found REST, which was what he 
reckoned he needed. He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was 
about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at 
the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second 
and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and 
lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or 
received. 

He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few 
likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his 
satchel again. 

He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff 
and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the 
Guide. 

When all the information that he could think was relevant had 
been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly 
in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, 
and went in search of the ship's computer data banks. 



Chapter 20 


"The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the 
summer, especially in parks," said the voice earnestly, "is to make 
girl's breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am 
convinced that this is the case." 

Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they 
passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment. 

"And I am certain," said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the long 
thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the 
Serpentine, "that if one worked the argument through, one would 
find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from 
everything," he insisted to his thin dark-haired companion who was 
slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots, 
"that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable. 
And," he added, "I love it." 

He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at 
Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently 
quaking. 

"Next guess," she said, when she had stopped giggling, "come on." 

"All right," he said, "your elbow. Your left elbow. There's something 
wrong with your left elbow." 

"Wrong again," she said, "completely wrong. You're on completely 
the wrong track." 

The summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park, looking 
as if - Let's not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about 
it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the 
ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a 
summer's evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through 
in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face. 

It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they 
do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practising 
the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an 



American couple who had tried, timidly to put some coins on the box 
his bagpipes came in. 

"No!" he shouted at them, "go away! I'm only practising." 

He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this 
made could not disfigure their mood. 

Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly 
downwards. 

"I don't think it can be your bottom," he said after a while," there 
doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that at all." 

"Yes," she agreed, "there's absolutely nothing wrong with my 
bottom." 

They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and 
practised on the other side of the tree. 

"I'll tell you a story," said Arthur. 

"Good." 

They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples 
actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning 
ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath 
the stunning ducks. 

"A story," said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her. 

"Which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to 
me. It's absolutely true." 

"You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to 
be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend, but 
actually probably got made up somewhere along the line." 

"Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, 
and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually 
happened to was me." 

"Like the raffle ticket." 

Arthur laughed. "Yes. I had a train to catch," he went on. "I arrived 
at the station..." 

"Did I ever tell you," interrupted Fenchurch, "what happened to my 
parents in a station?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, "you did." 

"Just checking." 



Arthur glanced at his watch. "I suppose we could think of getting 
back," he said. 

"Tell me the story," said Fenchurch firmly. "You arrived at the 
station." 

"I was about twenty minutes early. I'd got the time of the train 
wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible," he added after a 
moment's reflection, "that British Rail had got the time of the train 
wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before." 

"Get on with it." Fenchurch laughed. 

"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the 
buffet to get a cup of coffee." 

"You do the crossword?" 

"Yes." 

"Which one?" 

"The Guardian usually." 

"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer the Times. Did you solve it?" 

"What?" 

"The crossword in The Guardian." 

"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet," said Arthur, "I'm still 
trying to buy the coffee." 

"All right then. Buy the coffee." 

"I'm buying it. I am also," said Arthur, "buying some biscuits." 

"What sort?" 

"Rich Tea." 

"Good choice." 

"I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a 
table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was 
some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round." 

"All right." 

"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, 
the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the 
table, the packet of biscuits." 

"I see it perfectly." 



"What you don't see," said Arthur, "because I haven't mentioned 
him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there 
opposite me." 

"What's he like?" 

"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look," said 
Arthur, "as if he was about to do anything weird." 

"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?" 

"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of 
biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and..." 

"What?" 

"Ate it." 

"What?" 

"He ate it." 

Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "What on Earth did you 
do?" 

"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman 
would do. I was compelled," said Arthur, "to ignore it." 

"What? Why?" 

"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched 
my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my 
upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to 
react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in 
front of me, stolen one of my biscuits." 

"Well, you could..." Fenchurch thought about it. "I must say I'm not 
sure what I would have done either. So what happened?" 

"I stared furiously at the crossword," said Arthur. "Couldn't do a 
single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was 
nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to 
notice," he added, "that the packet was already mysteriously open..." 

"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line." 

"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately 
and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was 
doing. When I eat a biscuit," Arthur said, "it stays eaten." 

"So what did he do?" 



"Took another one. Honestly," insisted Arthur, "this is exactly what 
happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain 
as we are sitting on the ground." 

Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 

"And the problem was," said Arthur, "that having not said anything 
the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the 
subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me... I 
couldn't help noticing, er...' Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if 
anything, even more vigour than previously." 

"My man..." 

"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so 
showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin's Day..." 

"What?" 

"I went into the breach again. I took," said Arthur, "another biscuit. 
And for an instant our eyes met." 

"Like this?" 

"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. 
And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you," said Arthur, 

"that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension 
building up over the table. At about this time." 

"I can imagine." 

"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me ..." 

"The whole packet?" 

"Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of 
biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly 
have had a tougher time." 

"Gladiators," said Fenchurch, "would have had to do it in the sun. 
More physically gruelling." 

"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between 
us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a 
sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a 
moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the 
newspaper, and underneath the newspaper..." 

"Yes?" 

"Were my biscuits." 

"What?" said Fenchurch. "What?" 



"True." 

"No!" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing. 

She sat up again. 

"You completely nitwit," she hooted, "you almost completely and 
utterly foolish person." 

She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled 
off again. He was surprised at how light she was. 

"Now you tell me a story." 

"I thought," she said putting on a low husky voice, "that you were 
very keen to get back." 

"No hurry," he said airily, "I want you to tell me a story." 

She looked out over the kale and pondered. 

"All right," she said, "it's only a short one. And not funny like yours, 
but... Anyway." 

She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of 
moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur 
wished that the air would go away and mind its own business. 

"When I was a kid," she said. "These sort of stories always start like 
this, don't they, 'When I was a kid...' Anyway. This is the bit where the 
girl suddenly says, 'When I was a kid' and starts to unburden herself. 
We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging 
over the foot of my bed... What do you think of it so far?" 

"I like it. I think it's moving well. You're getting the bedroom 
interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some 
development with the picture." 

"It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like," 
she said, "but don't. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing 
things, you know?" 

"I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats." 

"Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats 
and owls. There may even have been a reindeer." 

"On the raft." 

"On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft." 

"Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer." 

"Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety." 

"Ugh." 



"The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming 
in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about 
this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it 
who shouldn't even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to 
pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. Worried me. 
Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time. 

"Then one day - and remember I'd been looking at this picture 
every night for years - I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. 
Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just swimming 
along." 

She shrugged. 

"Good story?" she said. 

"Ends weakly," said Arthur, "leaves the audience crying 'Yes, but 
what of it?' Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the 
credits." 

Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs. 

"It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed 
worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and 
white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered. The 
sudden shift of perspective that says 'Put away your worries, the 
world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.' You probably 
thing I'm saying that because I'm going to say that I felt like that this 
afternoon or something, don't you?" 

"Well, I..." said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered. 

"Well, it's all right," she said, "I did. That's exactly what I felt. But 
you see, I've felt that before, even stronger. Incredibly strongly. I'm 
afraid I'm a bit of a one," she said gazing off into the distance, "for 
sudden startling revelations." 

Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, 
for the moment not to try. 

"It was very odd," she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians 
might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses 
waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side. 

"Very odd," she repeated, "for days before, the strangest feeling 
had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it wasn't 
like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into 



something, bit by bit. No, not even that; it was as if the whole of the 
Earth, through me, was going to..." 

"Does the number," said Arthur gently, "forty-two mean anything 
to you at all?" 

"What? No, what are you talking about?" exclaimed Fenchurch. 

"Just a thought," murmured Arthur. 

"Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious." 

"I was being perfectly serious," said Arthur. "It's just the Universe 
I'm never quite sure about." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"Tell me the rest of it," he said. "Don't worry if it sounds odd. 

Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff," 
he added, "that is odd. And I don't mean biscuits." 

She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his 
arm. 

"It was so simple," she said, "so wonderfully and extraordinarily 
simple, when it came." 

"What was it?" said Arthur quietly. 

"Arthur, you see," she said, "that's what I no longer know. And the 
loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and 
jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black 
out." 

"What?" 

"Well, like your story," she said, "the best bit happened in a cafe. I 
was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build 
up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently. 
And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the cafe, 
and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, 
which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people 
working. And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from 
somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I 
just sat up and thought, 'Oh! Oh, well that's all right then.' I was so 
startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes," 
she added thoughtfully, "I'm sure I did. How much sense am I 
making?" 

"It was fine up to the bit about the teacup." 



She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, 
which is what she was trying to do. 

"Well that's it," she said. "Fine up to the bit about the teacup. That 
was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world 
exploded." 

"What...?" 

"I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, 
but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 
3D with 16-track Dolby Stereo and should probably hire myself out to 
people who are bored with shark movies. It was as if the ground was 
literally ripped from under my feet, and... and..." 

She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed 
to change her mind about what she was going to say. 

"And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I've been in and out ever 
since. And that's why I have an instinctive nervousness," she said, "of 
sudden startling revelations that's everything's going to be all right." 
She looked up at him. 

Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange 
anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had 
consigned them to that part of his mind marked "Things to think 
about - Urgent." "Here is the world," he had told himself. "Here, for 
whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on it." But 
now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the 
car when Fenchurch's brother had told him the silly stories about the 
CIA agent in the reservoir. The trees went swimmy. The lake went 
swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by 
because a grey goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a 
great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know 
the questions to. 

"Anyway," said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide- 
eyed smile, "there is something wrong with part of me, and you've 
got to find out what it is. We'll go home." 

Arthur shook his head. 

"What's the matter?" she said. 

Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion 
which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world's great 
suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free 



himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was 
least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a 
door and go boo at him. 

"I'm just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind," said Arthur, 
"you say you felt as if the Earth actually... exploded ..." 

"Yes. More than felt." 

"Which is what everybody else says," he said hesitantly, "is 
hallucinations?" 

"Yes, but Arthur that's ridiculous. People think that if you just say 
'hallucinations' it explains anything you want it to explain and 
eventually whatever it is you can't understand will just go away. It's 
just a word, it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't explain why the 
dolphins disappeared." 

"No," said Arthur. "No," he added thoughtfully. "No," he added 
again, even more thoughtfully. "What?" he said at last. 

"Doesn't explain the dolphins disappearing." 

"No," said Arthur, "I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?" 

"What do you mean which dolphins? I'm talking about when all the 
dolphins disappeared." 

She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the 
tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his 
back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so 
often got when people were trying to explain things to him. 

"The dolphins?" 

"Yes." 

"All the dolphins," said Arthur, "disappeared?" 

"Yes." 

"The dolphins? You're saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this," 
said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, "what you're 
saying?" 

"Arthur where have you been for heaven's sake? The dolphins all 
disappeared on the same day I..." 

She stared him intently in his startled eyes. 

"What...?" 

"No dolphins. All gone. Vanished." 

She searched his face. 



"Did you really not know that?" 

It was clear from his startled expression that he did not. 

"Where did they go?" he asked. 

"No one knows. That's what vanished means." She paused. "Well, 
there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he 
lives in California," she said, "and is mad. I was thinking of going to 
see him because it seems the only lead I've got on what happened to 
me." 

She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She lay her 
hand on the side of his face. 

"I really would like to know where you've been," she said. "I think 
something terrible happened to you then as well. And that's why we 
recognized each other." 

She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into 
the clutches of dusk. 

"Well," she said, "now you've got someone you can tell." 

Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh. 

"It is," he said, "a very long story." 

Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag. 

"Is it anything to do with this?" she said. The thing she took out of 
her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into 
prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the 
deserts of Kakrafoon, half-buried in the marbled sands that fringe the 
heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the 
moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and 
generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were 
exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had 
thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in 
large friendly letters, the words "Don't Panic". 

"Where did you get this?" said Arthur, startled, taking it from her. 

"Ah," she said, "I thought it was yours. In Russell's car that night. 
You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?" 

Arthur drew the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from its cover. It 
was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some buttons 
till the screen flared with text. 


"A few," he said. 



"Can we go to them?" 

"What? No," said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented 
warily. "Do you want to?" he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an 
act of great generosity on his part not to say, "You don't want to, do 
you?" which expects it. 

"Yes," she said. "I want to know what the message was that I lost, 
and where it came from. Because I don't think," she added, standing 
up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, "that it came 
from here." 

"I'm not even sure," she further added, slipping her arm around 
Arthur's waist, "that I know where here is." 



Chapter 21 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked 
before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is, 
essentially, as the title implies, a Guide book. The problem is, or 
rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable portion of 
which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial and criminal 
courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the 
more corrupt ones, this. 

The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem. 

This is: 

Change. 

Read it through again and you'll get it. 

The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of 
it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. 
A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and 
conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed 
and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing 
circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute 
of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you 
would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all 
the editors of the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the 
meanings of the words "scrupulous", "conscientious" or "diligent", 
and tends to get his nightmares through a straw. 

Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub-Etha Net 
according to if they read good. 

Take for example, the case of Brequinda on the Foth of Avalars, 
famed in myth, legend and stultifyingly dull tri-d mini-serieses as 
home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon. 

In Ancient days, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux 
held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but 
everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how 
on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely 



likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air 
and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone's guess, virgins, it was not 
possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without 
hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons. 

Whether you would want to do that is another matter. 

Not that Fire Dragons weren't an essentially peace-loving species, 
because they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring 
of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the 
one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like 
a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence. Another problem was 
that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a 
lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the 
relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the 
place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on 
Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons. 

But did they mind? They did not. 

Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No. 

The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of 
Brequinda in the Foth of valors for their savage beauty, their noble 
ways and their habit of biting people who didn't revere them. 

Why was this? 

The answer was simple. 

Sex. 

There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost 
unbearably sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons 
flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already 
dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side. 

Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brequinda 
in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have 
stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for 
no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied 
Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon 
than half the people of Brequinda are scurrying off into the woods 
with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together 
and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still 
claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky 
virgins. 



Pheromones, some researchers said. 

Something sonic, others claimed. 

The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the 
bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it. 

Not surprisingly, the Guide's graphically enticing description of the 
general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly 
popular amongst hitch-hikers who allow themselves to be Guided by 
it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to 
latter-day travellers to find out for themselves that today's modern 
Brequinda in the City State of Avalars is now little more than concrete, 
strip joints and Dragon Burger Bars. 



Chapter 22 


The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant. 

There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, 
but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off 
across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed. 

Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle 
of their American Flots with extra anchovy they could always have 
sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now 
known to have much the same effect. 

"No," said Fenchurch, "not yet." 

Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the 
upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night 
air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very 
close to the open bottle of champagne. 

"No," said Fenchurch, "not till you've found out what's wrong with 
me, which bit. But I suppose," she added very, very, very quietly, "that 
we may as well start with where your hand is now." 

Arthur said, "So which way do I go?" 

"Down," said Fenchurch, "on this occasion." 

Fie moved his hand. 

"Down," she said, "is in fact the other way." 

"Oh yes." 

Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter 
Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, 
exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer - which 
is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn't yet got to 
that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and 
furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list 
and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are 
still moving slowly. 



"And so we come," said Arthur, "to your knee. There is something 
terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee." 

"My left knee," said Fenchurch, "is absolutely fine." 

"Do it is." 

"Did you know that..." 

"What?" 

"Ahm, it's all right. I can tell you do. No, keep going." 

"So it has to be something to do with your feet..." 

She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders 
noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the 
Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the 
swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled 
against, particularly if it's noncommittally because of the syncopated 
way in which the shoulders move, it's a pity they weren't there. They 
weren't, but such is life. 

Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully. All 
kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was 
making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point. 

"I have to admit," he said, "that I really don't know what I'm 
looking for." 

"You'll know when you find it," she said. "Really you will." There 
was a slight catch in her voice. "It's not that one." 

Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on the 
floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. 
She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the 
record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would 
know made it impossible not to do this. 

Then she gave him her right foot. 

Fie stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along 
her instep, could find nothing wrong with it. 

She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her 
head. 

"No, don't stop," she said, "but it's not that one now." 

Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor. 

"Don't stop." 



He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under 
her toes, along her instep and said, "You mean it's something to do 
with which leg I'm holding...?" 

She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy 
into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta. 

He frowned. 

"Pick me up," she said quietly. 

He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she. He 
picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a 
while, then she said, "Now put me down again." 

Still puzzled, he did so. 

"Well?" 

She looked at him almost challengingly. 

"So what's wrong with my feet?" she said. 

Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down 
on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their 
normal habitat. And as he looked closely, something odd struck him. 
He pit his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a 
long pause. He sat back heavily. 

"Yes," he said, "I see what's wrong with your feet. They don't touch 
the ground." 

"So... so what do you think...?" 

Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension 
making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling. 

"What do..." she stammered. "Are you...?" She shook the hair 
forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fea rful tears. 

He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single 
kiss. 

"Perhaps you can do what I can do," he said, and walked straight 
out of her upstairs front door. 

The record got to the good bit. 



Chapter 23 


The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the fierce 
and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and 
wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian 
ship was able to deploy. 

Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same 
blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed 
through it. 

The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they 
were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of 
the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly 
disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit 
behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left 
the field of battle. 

All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the 
ship was gone. 

With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast 
tracts of irrationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and above all, 
quietly. 

Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance 
hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old 
haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York. 

In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, 
beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that 
new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding 
welfare and voting rights. 

One of those now floated past, waving. Ford waved back. 

The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank. 

"Hi," it said, "I've just been created. I'm completely new to the 
Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?" 

"Phew," said Ford, a little nonplussed, "I can tell you where some 
bars are, I guess." 



"What about love and happiness. I sense deep needs for things like 
that," it said, waving its tentacles. "Got any leads there?" 

"You can get some like what you require," said Ford, "on Seventh 
Avenue." 

"I instinctively feel," said the creature, urgently, "that I need to be 
beautiful. Am I?" 

"You're pretty direct, aren't you?" 

"No point in mucking about. Am I?" 

"To me?" said Ford. "No. But listen," he added after a moment, 
"most people make out, you know. Are there and like you down 
there?" 

"Search me, buster," said the creature, "as I said, I'm new here. Life 
is entirely strange to me. What's it like?" 

Flere was something that Ford felt he could speak about with 
authority. 

"Life," he said, "is like a grapefruit." 

"Er, how so?" 

"Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet 
and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some 
people have half a one for breakfast." 

"Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?" 

"I expect so," said Ford. "Ask a policeman." 

Deep in his bunk. Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other 
side. It wasn't his favourite type of dream because it didn't have 
Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon VI in it, 
whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At 
least he was asleep. 



Chapter 24 


Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur 
hadn't done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, 
and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it. 

He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on 
the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly 
stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he 
completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn't. 

A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it. 

The ground was hanging menacingly above his head. 

He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big 
thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop 
hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice 
thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to 
do because he couldn't at that moment remember precisely what a 
lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic 
herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, 
so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without 
simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness towards 
things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to 
adjust to the fact that it wasn't touching anything. 

A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway. 

After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually 
allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground. 

"Arthur..." 

The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he 
thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall 
away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very, very slowly. 

As he fell slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes - carefully, so 
as not to jolt anything. 

The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had 
reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact 



that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, 
very, very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other. 

That should sort the ground out. 

He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him 
quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very 
slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes. 

He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until 
all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different. 

Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a 
slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of 
things, being in the air. 

Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards 
off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street. 

Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed 
to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which 
meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the 
evening was beginning to draw in. He was, therefore, safely shrouded 
in a blanket of dark obscurity. 

He slowly, very, very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was 
standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs 
doorway. 

Her face was inches from his. 

"I was about to ask you," she said in a low trembly voice, "what you 
were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you were doing. 
You were flying. So it seemed," she went on after a slight wondering 
pause, "like a bit of a silly question." 

Arthur said, "Can you do it?" 

"No." 

"Would you like to try?" 

She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just 
in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf. 

"It's quite easy," urged Arthur, "if you don't know how. That's the 
important bit. Be not at all sure how you're doing it." 

Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the 
alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her 
like a banknote on a breath of wind. 



"Ask me how I did that." 

"How... did you do that?" 

"No idea. Not a clue." 

She shrugged in bewilderment. "So how can I...?" 

Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand. 

"I want you to try," he said, "to step on my hand. Just one foot." 

"What?" 

"Try it." 

Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying 
to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in 
midair, she stepped on to his hand. 

"Now the other." 

"What?" 

"Take the weight off your back foot." 

"I can't." 

"Try it." 

"Like this?" 

"Like that." 

Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if - She stopped 
telling herself what she was doing was like because she had a feeling 
she didn't altogether want to know. 

She fixed her eyes very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the 
decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks 
because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone 
was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say 
something to somebody, and didn't think for a moment about the fact 
that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn't standing 
on anything at all. 

"Now," said Arthur, "take your weight off your left foot." 

She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company 
who had their offices round the corner, and took the weight off her 
left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter. 

"Now," said Arthur, "take the weight off your right foot." 

"I can't." 

"Try." 



She hadn't seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it 
looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there might 
also be a bird's nest. If she leaned forward just a little and took her 
weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly. 

Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was 
trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn't want to get involved 
in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it 
quietly and not look up. 

He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole 
bicycles in alleys and habitually didn't expect to find their owners 
hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both these 
habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and 
when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of 
tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully 
bent both its wheels and went on his way. 

Arthur let out a long-held breath. 

"See what a piece of eggshell I have found you," said Fenchurch in 
his ear. 



Chapter 25 


Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may 
have received an impression of his character and habits which, while 
it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls 
somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its 
glorious aspects. 

And the reasons for this are obvious. Editing, selection, the need to 
balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut 
out all the tedious happenstance. 

Like this for instance. "Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the 
stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took 
off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one 
and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his 
pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed his face and hands, 
cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once 
again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again and 
went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten 
minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to 
the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute 
or so more was asleep. 

"It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour. 

"After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then 
turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after this his eyes 
flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was 
still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left 
side. And so he whiled the night away, sleeping. 

"At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the 
door to the lavatory..." and so on. 

It's guff. It doesn't advance the action. It makes for nice fat books 
such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn't actually get 
you anywhere. You don't, in short, want to know. 



But there are other omissions as well, beside the teethcleaning and 
trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have 
often seemed inordinately interested. 

What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with 
Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere? 

To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business. 

And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet 
Krikkit? Just because the planet didn't have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or 
Dire Straits doesn't mean that everyone just sat up every night 
reading. 

Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the 
committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur found 
himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly 
burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, 
recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a 
hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of 
toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the 
planet Golgafrincham. What then? What happened next? And the 
answer is, of course, that the book ended. 

The next one didn't resume the story till five years later, and you 
can, claim some, take discretion too far. "This Arthur Dent," comes 
the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now 
been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to 
originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to 
contemplate, "What is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing 
more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he 
no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?" 

Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip 
on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it. 



Chapter 26 


Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as 
they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had 
always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but dull, 
were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a 
while, that he thought of them. 

They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore 
seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the 
other way. 

And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic 
knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and 
utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up 
to do. 

Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on 
keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards the 
Westway flyover, on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure 
that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went 
splat upon the ground. 

Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of light of 
London - London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the 
strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, 
lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, 
but London - swayed, swaying and turning, turned. 

"Try a swoop," he called to Fenchurch. 

"What?" 

Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty 
air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief - all those things, clear, 
faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time. 

"We're flying..." she said. 

"A trifle," called Arthur, "think nothing of it. Try a swoop." 

"A sw -" 



Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too, and 
stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at 
nothing. 

Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone too, 
sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice. 

They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn't 
do this sort of thing here. 

He couldn't catch her because this was London, and not a million 
miles from here, seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in Pisa, 
Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly 
the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights. 

They fell. 

Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was 
going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians 
had to say about physics when they couldn't even keep a simple 
tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn well did fall 
faster than Fenchurch. 

He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her 
shoulders. He got it. 

Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and 
romantic, but didn't solve the basic problem, which was that they 
were falling, and the ground wasn't waiting around to see if he had 
any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them 
like an express train. 

He couldn't support her weight, he hadn't anything he could 
support it with or against. The only thing he could think was that they 
were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the 
obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than 
the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar territory. 

He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to 
him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little 
finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily up after her. 

"Shit," she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely 
nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up 
into the night. 

Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had 
impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any 



too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in 
passing. 

Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she 
judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off 
some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, 
followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and 
this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford 
Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later 
chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her 
take it off. 

It drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck 
which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons 
revolutionized the life of a family on Flounslow, over whose washing 
line it was discovered draped in the morning. 

In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming 
amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering 
around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are 
sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little 
scratchy perspex window while somebody else's son tries patiently to 
pour warm milk into your shirt. 

Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, 
wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt, even 
Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple of 
fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let 
the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of 
atmosphere could go and whistle. 

The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch 
rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very, 
very slowly, which is the only way it's possible to do it when you're 
flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable 
havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, 
Isleworth and Richmond. 

They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very 
high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly 
spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that 
above the clouds is where the night get seriously moonlit. 

The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up there, 
but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows. 



They had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulo-nimbus, 
and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased 
Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them till all were 
gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping 
whiteness. 

She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were 
drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T-shape, which 
might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, 
replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little. 

There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor 
could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater 
Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the constellation Fraz, 
and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are sadly 
extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again. 

The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the 
above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very 
similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or 
two later. 

They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in the air 
with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of 
screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to 
be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were 
doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz. 

This time, however, there was a heart-sickening fall or loss of nerve, 
a re-grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea 
enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise. 

Mr.s E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady, 
indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a lot of it, 
been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late 
stage, bored by too much. It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a 
little too explicable, a little too routine. 

With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and 
looked out over the wing. 

At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she 
thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone. 

By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the 
wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot. 



She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually 
everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong. 

The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the 
alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored. 

The following night they did it all over again, only this time with 
Sony Walkmen. 



Chapter 27 


"This is all very wonderful," said Fenchurch a few days later. "But I 
do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there's this 
difference between us. That you lost something and found it again, 
and I found something and lost it. I need to find it again." 

She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of 
telephoning. 

Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with 
small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say that 
he was none the worse for it, but sadly, this was not the case. He 
happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur 
phoned him anyway. 

"Arthur my old soup spoon, my old silver turreen, how particularly 
stunning to hear from you. Someone told me you'd gone off into 
space or something." 

Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he 
had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to 
speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all. The 
bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that 
no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of nonsense. 
The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was 
often a bad time for all concerned. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Just a rumour my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card 
table, just a rumour. Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a 
quote from you." 

"Nothing to say, just pub talk." 

"We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus it 
would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other 
stories of the week, so it could be just to have you denying it. Excuse 
me, something has just fallen out of my ear." 



There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson 
came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken. 

"Just remembered," he said, "what an odd evening I had last night. 
Anyway my old, I won't say what, how do you feel about having 
ridden on Halley's Comet?" 

"I haven't," said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, "ridden on Halley's 
Comet." 

"OK, How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley's Comet?" 

"Pretty relaxed, Murray." 

There was a pause while Murray wrote this down. 

"Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and 
the chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of 
the Weirdos, we're thinking of calling it. Good, eh?" 

"Very good." 

"Got a ring to it. First we have this man it always rains on." 

"What?" 

"It's the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his little 
black book, it all checks out at every single funloving level. The Met 
Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in 
white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers 
and boxes and drip feeds. This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is 
the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of 
erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world. 
We're calling him the Rain God. Nice, eh?" 

"I think I've met him." 

"Good ring to it. What did you say?" 

"I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?" 

"Incredible! You met the Rain God?" 

"If it's the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show 
someone his book." 

There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson's end of 
the phone. 

"Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been 
done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying 
that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget irrigating the 
Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career 



ahead of him, just avoiding places for money. The man's turning into a 
monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo. 

"Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who 
Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?" 

"A nice one, but..." 

"We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but 
that'll be OK. Where are you?" 

"Er, I'm in Islington. Listen, Murray..." 

"Islington!" 

"Yes..." 

"Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real 
seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying people?" 

"No." 

"You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is the 
real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the time to say 
there's this couple who go flying nights. We've got guys down in our 
photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine 
photograph. You must have heard." 

"No." 

"Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote. 
But that was months ago. Listen, it's night after night this week, my 
old cheesegrater, right on your patch. This couple just fly around the 
sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I don't mean looking through 
walls or pretending to be box girder bridges. You don't know 
anything?" 

"No." 

"Arthur, it's been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with 
you, chumbum, but I have to go. I'll send the guy with the camera and 
the hose. Give me the address, I'm ready and writing." 

"Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something." 

"I have a lot to do." 

"I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins." 

"No story. Last year's news. Forget 'em. They're gone." 

"It's important." 

"Listen, no one will touch it. You can't sustain a story, you know, 
when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever the story's 



about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays. Maybe they'll run a 
little 'Whatever Happened to "Whatever Happened to the Dolphins'" 
story in a couple of years, around August. But what's anybody going 
to do now? 'Dolphins still gone'? 'Continuing Dolphin Absence'? 
'Dolphins - Further Days Without Them'? The story dies, Arthur. It lies 
down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great 
golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat." 

"Murray, I'm not interested in whether it's a story. I just want to 
find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims 
to know something about it. I thought you might know." 



Chapter 28 


"People are beginning to talk," said Fenchurch that evening, after 
they had hauled her 'cello in. 

"Not only talk," said Arthur, "but print, in big bold letters under the 
bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I'd better get these." 

He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets. 

"Arthur!" she said, hugging him. "Does that mean you managed to 
talk to him?" 

"I have had a day," said Arthur, "of extreme telephonic exhaustion. 

I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in 
Fleet street, and I finally tracked his number down." 

"You've obviously been working hard, you're drenched with sweat 
poor darling." 

"Not with sweat," said Arthur wearily. "A photographer's just been. 

I tried to argue, but - never mind, the point is, yes." 

"You spoke to him." 

"I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the 
phone right now and could I call back." 

He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went 
to the fridge to find it. 

"Want a drink?" 

"Would commit murder to get one. I always know I'm in for a tough 
time when my 'cello teacher looks me up and down and says, 'Ah yes, 
my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.'." 

"I called again," said Arthur, "and she said that he was 3.2 light 
years from the phone and I should call back." 

"Ah." 

"I called again. "She said the situation had improved. He was now a 
mere 2.6 light years from the phone but it was still a long way to 
shout." 



"You don't suppose," said Fenchurch, doubtfully, "that there's 
anyone else we can talk to?" 

"It gets worse," said Arthur, "I spoke to someone on a science 
magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will 
not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated 
to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Doctor 
Scholl footwear, that the month's most fashionable silly theory is true. 
For people who question the validity of these visions he will 
triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that's as far as you 
get." 

"I didn't realize it was that bad," said Fenchurch quietly. She fiddled 
listlessly with the tickets. 

"I phoned Mrs. Watson again," said Arthur. "Fler name, by the way, 
and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill." 

"I see." 

"I'm glad you see. I thought you mightn't believe any of this, so 
when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to 
record the call." 

Fie went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed 
with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was 
particularly recommended by Which magazine and is almost 
impossible to use without going mad. 

"Flere it is," he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow. 

The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary 
satellite and back, but it was also hauntingly calm. 

"Perhaps I should explain," Arcane Jill Watson's voice said, "that 
the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into. It's in the 
Asylum you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum 
and so he does not. I feel you should know this because it may save 
you phoning. If you would like to meet him, this is very easily 
arranged. All you have to do is walk in. Fie will only meet people 
outside the Asylum." 

Arthur's voice, at its most mystified: "I'm sorry, I don't understand. 
Where is the asylum?" 

"Where is the Asylum?" Arcane Jill Watson again. "Flave you ever 
read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?" 

On the tape, Arthur's voice had to admit that he had not. 



"You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things for 
you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is. 
Thank you." 

The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine 
off. 

"Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation," he said with a 
shrug. "I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the 
science magazine." 

Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and 
looked at the tickets again. 

"Do you think it's worth it?" she said. 

"Well," said Arthur, "the one thing that everyone I spoke to agrees 
on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad, is 
that he does know more than any man living about dolphins." 



Chapter 29 


"This is an important announcement. This is flight 121 to Los 
Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now 
would be the perfect time to disembark." 



Chapter 30 


They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents 
out cars that other people have thrown away. 

"Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem," said the guy 
behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, "sometimes it's 
simpler just to get out and find a car that's going in that direction." 

They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which 
someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by. 

"Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They've got a 
swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars 
reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers." 

It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was doing. 

The garage attendant didn't think much of their car, but that was 
fine because they didn't either. 

Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along 
Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea 
of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across 
the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley. They 
agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of 
their eyes and didn't touch any other part of them and came away 
strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, 
it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having 
driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was 
illuminating they didn't think much of it. 

They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was 
stupidly hot. 

They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first 
look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all 
his days and a good deal of his nights looking at. 

"Someone told me," said Fenchurch, "that they once overheard 
two old ladies on this beach, doing what we're doing, looking at the 
Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently, after a 



long pause, one of them said to the other, 'You know, it's not as big as 
I expected."' 

Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the 
western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their 
rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility 
would dream of building a city like Los Angeles on front of, they were 
suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn't even 
mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and 
those simultaneously. So what, they were both playing good rock and 
roll. 

"I know he will be able to help us," said Fenchurch determinedly. "I 
know he will. What's his name again, that he likes to be called?" 

"Wonko the Sane." 

"I know that he will be able to help us." 

Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped 
that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, 
whatever this Earth might prove to be. 

He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time 
they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he 
would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had 
very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his 
memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him. 

In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed 
to be a converted warehouse. 

Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious. 

Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry. 

He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her. 

"Why's this fish so bloody good?" he demanded, angrily. 

"Please excuse my friend," said Fenchurch to the startled waitress. 
"I think he's having a nice day at last." 



Chapter 31 


If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David 
Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another 
David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first 
two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty 
beach robe you would then have something which didn't exactly look 
like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find 
hauntingly familiar. 

He was tall and he gangled. 

When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with 
any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, 
it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he 
began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm 
in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took 
your thumb off. 

But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It 
seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, 
but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order 
on his face, made you suddenly fee, "Oh. Well that's all right then." 

When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made 
you feel like that pretty often. 

"Oh yes," he said, "they come and see me. They sit right here. They 
sit right where you're sitting." 

He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green 
wings and Dr. Scholl sandals. 

"They eat nachos which they say they can't get where they come 
from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole 
range of things." 

"Do they?" said Arthur. "Are they? So, er... when is this then? 

When do they come?" 

He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers 
running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this 



problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had 
just washed over, but they couldn't bear to get their feet wet. To deal 
with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they'd 
been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland. 

Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with 
her fingers. 

"Weekends, mostly," said Wonko the Sane, "on little scooters. They 
are great machines." He smiled. 

"I see," said Arthur. "I see." 

A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked 
round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the 
sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he thought she 
was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking 
him. "Who are we," she was saying, "to say he's mad?" 

His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing 
that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know 
what it was like. 

What it was like was this: 

It was inside out. 

Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the 
carpet. 

All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was 
decorated in a tasteful interior-designed pink, were bookshelves, also 
a couple of those odd three-legged tables with semi-circular tops 
which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped 
the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly 
designed to soothe. 

Where it got really odd was the roof. 

It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C. Escher, had 
he been given to hard nights on the town, which is no part of this 
narrative's purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes 
hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with the awkward 
steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on 
one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside 
were on the outside pointing up. 

Confusing. 



The sign above the front door said, "Come Outside", and so, 
nervously, they had. 

Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork, 
nicely done painting, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple 
of small trees, some rooms leading off. 

And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened 
at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had Maurits C. 
Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the 
Pacific Ocean itself. 

"Hello," said John Watson, Wonko the Sane. 

Good, they thought to themselves, "Hello" is something we can 
cope with. 

"Hello," they said, and all surprisingly was smiles. 

For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the 
dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, "I forget..." whenever 
they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the 
eccentricities of his house. 

"It gives me pleasure," he said, "in a curious kind of way, and does 
nobody any harm," he continued, "that a competent optician couldn't 
correct." 

They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able 
to mock himself before anybody else did. 

"Your wife," said Arthur, looking around, "mentioned some 
toothpicks." He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that 
she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them 
again. 

Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded 
like one he had used a lot before and was happy with. 

"Ah yes," he said, "that's to so with the day I finally realized that 
the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor 
thing, and hoped it would get better." 

This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous 
again. 

"Here," said Wonko the Sane, "we are outside the Asylum." He 
pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering. 
"Go through that door," he pointed at the first door through which 
they had originally entered, "and you go into the Asylum. I've tried to 



decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there's very little 
one can do. I never go in there now myself. If ever I am tempted, 
which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the 
door and shy away." 

"That one?" said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue 
plaque with some instructions written on it. 

"Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I 
have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I 
had to do." 

The sign said: 

Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. 
Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion. 

"It seemed to me," said Wonko the sane, "that any civilization that 
had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed 
instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a 
civilization in which I could live and stay sane." 

He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber 
at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers. 

"And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it 
possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself 
Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is what 
my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things 
over, and sane is what I am, and how," he added, with one of his 
smiles that made you feel, "Oh. Well that's all right then." "I intend to 
remain. Shall we go on to the beach and see what we have to talk 
about?" 

They went out on to the beach, which was where he started talking 
about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl 
sandals. 

"About the dolphins..." said Fenchurch gently, hopefully. 

"I can show you the sandals," said Wonko the Sane. 

"I wonder, do you know..." 

"Would you like me to show you," said Wonko the Sane, "the 
sandals? I have them. I'll get them. They are made by the Dr. Scholl 
company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain 
they have to work in. They say they run a concession stand by the 



message. When I say I don't know what that means they say no, you 
don't, and laugh. Well, I'll get them anyway." 

As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on 
how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a 
wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and 
idly drew figures in the sand. 

"How are the feet today?" said Arthur quietly. 

"OK. It doesn't feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The water 
touches them perfectly. I just think this isn't our world." 

She shrugged. 

"What do you think he meant," she said, "by the message?" 

"I don't know," said Arthur, though the memory of a man called 
Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him. 

When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned 
Arthur. Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden- 
bottomed sandals. 

"I just thought you'd like to see," he said, "what angels wear on 
their feet. Just out of curiousity. I'm not trying to prove anything, by 
the way. I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the 
reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a 
scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, he 
must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was 
going to see or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. 
Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists 
forget that. I'll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the 
other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I 
am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You can't 
possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you're a fool. 
Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this." 

This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him 
carrying, for it was a wonderful silver-grey glass fish bowl, seemingly 
identical to the one in Arthur's bedroom. 

Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without 
success, to say, "Where did you get that?" sharply, and with a gasp in 
his voice. 

Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond. 



"Where did you get that?" said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp 
in her voice. 

Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice 
said, "What? Flave you seen one of these before?" 

"Yes," she said, "I've got one. Or at least I did have. Russell nicked it 
to put his golfballs in. I don't know where it came from, just that I was 
angry with Russell for nicking it. Why, have you got one?" 

"Yes, it was..." 

They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing 
sharply backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a 
gasp in edgeways. 

"You have one of those too?" he said to both of them. 

"Yes." They both said it. 

Fie looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the 
bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun. 

The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the 
intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the 
sand and upon them. Fie turned it, and turned it. They could see quite 
clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words "So Long, and 
Thanks For All The Fish." 

"Do you know," asked Wonko quietly, "what it is?" 

They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost 
hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass. 

"It is a farewell gift from the dolphins," said Wonko in a low quiet 
voice, "the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and 
fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they 
seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now 
realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they 
decided they wanted to." 

Fie shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again 
at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur. 

"Flave you..." he said to Arthur, "what have you done with yours? 
May I ask you that?" 

"Er, I keep a fish in it," said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. "I 
happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and, er, 
there was this bowl." Fie tailed off. 



"You've done nothing else? No," he said, "if you had, you would 
know." He shook his head again. 

"My wife kept wheatgerm in ours," resumed Wonko, with some 
new tone in his voice, "until last night..." 

"What," said Arthur slowly and hushedly, "happened last night?" 

"We ran out of wheatgerm," said Wonko, evenly. "My wife," he 
added, "has gone to get some more." He seemed lost with his own 
thoughts for a moment. 

"And what happened then?" said Fenchurch, in the same 
breathless tone. 

"I washed it," said Wonko. "I washed it very carefully, very very 
carefully, removing every last speck of wheatgerm, then I dried it 
slowly with a lint-free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over. 
Then I held it to my ear. Have you... have you held one to your ear?" 

They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly. 

"Perhaps," he said, "you should." 



Chapter 32 


The deep roar of the ocean. 

The break of waves on further shores than thought can find. 

The silent thunders of the deep. 

And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming 
trillings, wordlings, the half-articulated songs of thought. 

Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the 
inarticulate, words breaking together. 

A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth. 

Waves of joy on - where? A world indescribably found, 
indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water. 

A fugue of voices now, clamouring explanations, of a disaster 
unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a 
spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words. 

And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the 
implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of 
parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the 
flight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone. 

Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear. 

"This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the 
Humans. We bid you farewell." 

And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling 
away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling. 



Chapter 33 


That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from 
inside it. 

"This is what I wanted you to see," said Wonko the Sane when the 
news came around again, "an old colleague of mine. He's over in your 
country running an investigation. Just watch." 

It was a press conference. 

"I'm afraid I can't comment on the name Rain God at this present 
time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para- 
Causal Meteorological Phenomenon." 

"Can you tell us what that means?" 

"I'm not altogether sure. Let's be straight here. If we find 
something we can't understand we like to call it something you can't 
understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around 
calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something 
we don't, and I'm afraid we couldn't have that. 

"No, first we have to call it something which says it's ours, not 
yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it's not what 
you said it is, but something we say it is. 

"And if it turns out that you're right, you'll still be wrong, because 
we will simply call him a... er 'Supernormal...' - not paranormal or 
supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, 
a 'Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer'. We'll probably 
want to shove a 'Quasi' in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain 
God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you 
wouldn't catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that'll be all for 
now, other than to say 'Hi!' to Wonko if he's watching." 



Chapter 34 


On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the 
plane who was looking at them rather oddly. 

They talked quietly to themselves. 

"I still have to know," said Fenchurch, "and I strongly feel that you 
know something that you're not telling me." 

Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper. 

"Do you have a pencil?" he said. She dug around and found one. 

"What are you doing, sweetheart?" she said, after he had spent 
twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, 
crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and 
grunting irritably to himself. 

"Trying to remember an address someone once gave me." 

"Your life would be an awful lot simpler," she said, "if you bought 
yourself an address book." 

Finally he passed the paper to her. 

"You look after it," he said. 

She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out were 
the words "Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry. Planet of 
Preliumtarn. Sun-Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma." 

"And what's there?" 

"Apparently," said Arthur, "it's God's Final Message to His 
Creation." 

"That sounds a bit more like it," said Fenchurch. "Flow do we get 
there?" 

"You really...?" 

"Yes," said Fenchurch firmly, "I really want to know." 

Arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open 
sky outside. 



"Excuse me," said the woman who had been looking at them rather 
oddly, suddenly, "I hope you don't think I'm rude. I get so bored on 
these long flights, it's nice to talk to somebody. My name's Enid 
Kapelsen, I'm from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?" 



Chapter 35 


They went to Arthur's house in the West Country, shoved a couple 
of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every 
Galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing. 

They waited for a flying saucer to come by. 

"Friend of mine did this for fifteen years," said Arthur one night as 
they sat forlornly watching the sky. 

"Who was that?" 

"Called Ford Prefect." 

Fie caught himself doing something he had never really expected to 
do again. 

Fie wondered where Ford Prefect was. 

By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two 
reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incidents 
with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in 
pubs. 

Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and 
complaining that Arthur never answered the phone. 

In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he'd been pulled 
through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being 
simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. Fie 
staggered into Arthur's sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, 
which was an error, because the effort caused him to lose his balance 
altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa. 

"Thank you," said Ford, "thank you very much. Flave you..." he said, 
and fell asleep for three hours. 

"... the faintest idea" he continued suddenly, when he revived, 

"how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? 
I can see that you haven't, so I'll tell you," he said, "over the very large 
mug of black coffee that you are about to make me." 

Fie followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen. 



"Stupid operators keep asking you where you're calling from and 
you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn't be if 
you're coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?" 

"Making you some black coffee." 

"Oh." Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place 
forlornly. 

"What's this?" he said. 

"Rice Crispies." 

"And this?" 

"Paprika." 

"I see," said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, one 
on top of the other, but that didn't seem to balance properly, so he 
put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work. 

"A little space-lagged," he said. "What was I saying?" 

"About not phoning from Letchworth." 

"I wasn't. I explained this to the lady. 'Bugger Letchworth,' I said, 'if 
that's your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of 
a journey between the stars known on your world, though not 
necessarily to you, dear lady.' - I said 'dear lady'," explained Ford 
Prefect, "because I didn't want her to be offended by my implication 
that she was an ignorant cretin..." 

"Tactful," said Arthur Dent. 

"Exactly," said Ford, "tactful." 

He frowned. 

"Space-lag," he said, "is very bad for sub-clauses. You'll have to 
assist me again," he continued, "by reminding me what I was talking 
about." 

"'Between the stars,"' said Arthur, "'known on your world, though 
not necessarily to you, dear lady, as...'" 

"'Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,"' concluded Ford triumphantly. 
"This conversation lark is quite gas isn't it?" 

"Have some coffee." 

"Thank you, no. 'And the reason,' I said, 'why I am bothering you 
with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have 
some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in 



the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching son of a 
starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship insists that I call 
collect. Can you believe that?"' 

"And could she?" 

"I don't know. She had hung up," said Ford, "by this time. So! What 
do you suppose," he asked fiercely, "I did next?" 

"I've no idea, Ford," said Arthur. 

"Pity," said Ford, "I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate 
those guys you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, 
buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines 
that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no 
sane man would require of them and," he added savagely, "go beep 
to tell you when they've done it!" 

This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by 
right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right 
thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned 
lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, 
nine hundred and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, 
says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation product that "it is very easy 
to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of 
achievement you get from getting them to work at all. 

"In other words - and this is the rock solid principle on which the 
whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide success is founded - their 
fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial 
design flaws." 

"And this guy," ranted Ford, "was on a drive to sell more of them! 

His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and 
sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators 
and wine bars! Or if they didn't have restaurants, elevators and wine 
bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they 
bloody well did have! Where's that coffee!" 

"I threw it away." 

"Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I 
saved civilization as we know it. I knew it was something like that." 



He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he 
seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and 
making beep beep noises. 

A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur 
followed him. 

Ford looked stunned. 

"Where have you been?" he demanded. 

"Making some coffee," said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. 
He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford's company 
successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear 
them at all times. 

"You missed the best bit!" raged Ford. "You missed the bit where I 
jumped the guy! Now," he said, "I shall have to jump him, all over 
him!" 

He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it. 

"It was better," he said sullenly, "last time," and waved vaguely in 
the direction of another broken chair which he had already got 
trussed up on the dining table. 

"I see," said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up 
wreckage, "and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?" 

"What?" screamed Ford. "What? You missed that bit too? That's 
the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended 
animation facility. Well I had to didn't I?" 

"So it would seem," said Arthur, in his placid voice. 

"Don't touch that!!!" yelled Ford. 

Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some 
mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly. 

"OK," said Ford, calming down, "listen to it." 

Arthur put the phone to his ear. 

"It's the speaking clock," he said. 

"Beep, beep, beep," said Ford, "is exactly what is being heard all 
over that guy's ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a 
little-known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London Speaking Clock!" 

"I see," said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to 
ask the big one. 


"Why?" he said, placidly. 



"With a bit of luck," said Ford, "the phone bill will bankrupt the 
buggers." 

He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa. 

"Anyway," he said, "dramatic arrival don't you think?" 



Chapter 36 


The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had 
stunned the world. 

Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no 
hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs. 

This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely definite. 

It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath 
it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate 
in the world, including much of Flarrods. 

The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in 
colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered 
vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns 
unknown to man. 

A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Flarrods Food Flails, 
demolished Flarvey Nicholls, and with a final grinding scream of 
tortured architecture, toppled the Sheraton Park Tower. 

After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and 
grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the 
ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall. 

It held up a hand. 

"I come in peace," it said, adding after a long moment of further 
grinding, "take me to your Lizard." 

Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with 
Arthur and watched the non-stop frenetic news reports on the 
television, none of which had anything to say other than to record 
that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at 
that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other 
number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing 
nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting 
short incomprehensible error messages. 

"It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see..." 



"You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?" 

"No," said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and 
coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down 
him, "nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On 
its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people 
hate the lizards and the lizards role the people." 

"Odd," said Arthur, "I thought you said it was a democracy." 

"I did," said Ford. "It is." 

"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, 
"why don't people get rid of the lizards?" 

"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford. "They've all got the 
vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've 
voted in more or less approximates to the government they want." 

"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?" 

"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course." 

"But," said Arthur, going for the big one again, "why?" 

"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong 
lizard might get in. Got any gin?" 

"What?" 

"I said," said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into 
his voice, "have you got any gin?" 

"I'll look. Tell me about the lizards." 

Ford shrugged again. 

"Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever 
happened to them," he said. "They're completely wrong of course, 
completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it." 

"But that's terrible," said Arthur. 

"Listen, bud," said Ford, "if I had one Altairan dollar for every time I 
heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and 
say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a 
gin. But I haven't and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid 
and moon-eyed for? Are you in love?" 

Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly. 

"With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to 
meet her?" 



He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of 
newspapers she'd been into the village to buy. She stopped in 
astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from 
Betelgeuse on the sofa. 

"Where's the gin?" said Ford to Fenchurch. And to Arthur, "What 
happened to Trillian by the way?" 

"Er, this is Fenchurch," said Arthur, awkwardly. "There was nothing 
with Trillian, you must have seen her last." 

"Oh, yeah," said Ford, "she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They 
had some kids or something. At least," he added, "I think that's what 
they were. Zaphod's calmed down a lot you know." 

"Really?" said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to 
relieve her of the shopping. 

"Yeah," said Ford, "at least one of his heads is now saner than an 
emu on acid." 

"Arthur, who is this?" said Fenchurch. 

"Ford Prefect," said Arthur. "I may have mentioned him in passing." 



Chapter 37 


For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in 
stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying 
slightly and trying to work out a number of things. 

Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the 
truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they 
thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it - 
but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly. 

At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of 
television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did 
nothing. 

It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion. 

It would have to send out its service robots. 

It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number 
of problems. 

The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one 
afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding 
terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others. 

One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it 
instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little 
in the area survived. 

A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers 
discovered the Zoo in Regent's Park, and most particularly the reptile 
house. 

Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the 
petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and 
fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high- 
level talks with them. 

Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, 
frank and wide-ranging exchange of views the high level talks had 
broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot 



would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some reason selected 
Bournemouth. 

Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another 
beer. 

Immediate preparations were made for its departure. 

The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things 
with light throughout that day and all through the night time, and in 
the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll 
westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing 
on it, supported within the gantry. 

Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its 
servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land 
until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed 
itself from it transport system's embraces and went and lay for ten 
days on the beach. 

It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever 
happened to Bournemouth. 

Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out 
and guarded as the robot's recreation area, and tried to see what it 
was doing. 

It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little 
awkwardly on its face. 

It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed 
to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to 
strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service 
robots guarding the perimeter. 

It was an extraordinary breakthrough. 

"I think there's a story in it," confided the journalist over a cigarette 
shared through the steel link fence, "but it needs a good local angle. 
I've got a little list of questions here," he went on, rummaging 
awkwardly in an inner pocket, "perhaps you could get him, it, 
whatever you call him, to run through them quickly." 

The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold 
do and screeched off. 

A reply was never forthcoming. 

Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or 
less exactly matched the questions that were going through the 



massive battle-scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot's mind. 
They were these: 

"How do you feel about being a robot?" 

"How does it feel to be from outer space?" and 

"How do you like Bournemouth?" 

Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a 
few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave 
for good. 

"The point is," said Fenchurch to Ford, "can you get us on board?" 

Ford looked wildly at his watch. 

"I have some serious unfinished business to attend to," he 
exclaimed. 



Chapter 38 


Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, 
which wasn't very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and 
patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around that was 
the army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner 
perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. 
They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether 
they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from 
the public, or to guarantee the giant ship's diplomatic immunity and 
prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject 
of much debate. 

The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army 
stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the 
reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up 
and go. 

The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and 
now it was five o'clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been 
seen of it. Much had been heard - more grindings and rumblings from 
deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; 
but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the 
fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful 
extraordinary thing had come into their lives, an now it was simply 
going to go without them. 

Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and 
Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect 
in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being 
there. 

"Flow reliable is he?" asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice. 

"Flow reliable?" said Arthur. Fie gave a hollow laugh. "Flow shallow 
is the ocean?" he said. "Flow cold is the sun?" 

The last parts of the robot's gantry transport were being carried on 
board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were 



now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them. The 
soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were 
barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of 
course, could be done about any of it. 

Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch 
pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was 
also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them 
nowhere. 

And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship, 
every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fret saws 
and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and 
then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves. 

A few seconds passed. 

The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, 
and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of 
the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound 
of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored. 

"Hold it!" 

A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the 
edge of the milling crowd. 

"There has been," barked the megaphone, "a major scientific 
break-in! Through. Breakthrough," it corrected itself. The door flew 
open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse 
leapt out wearing a white coat. 

"Hold it!" he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squad 
black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused 
in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb 
(which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying 
to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly 
trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly 
ground its way downwards again. 

Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and 
started bawling at the crowd through it. 

"Make way," he shouted, "make way, please, this is a major 
scientific breakthrough. You and you, get the equipment from the 
taxi." 



Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who 
wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently 
round the taxi. 

"All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important 
pieces of scientific equipment," boomed Ford. "Just everybody keep 
calm. It's all under control, there's nothing to see. It is merely a major 
scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific 
equipment. Clear the way." 

Flungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from 
disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to 
open up. 

Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes 
of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi. 

"Hang your coat over them," he muttered to Fenchurch as he 
heaved them out to her. Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large 
supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat. It 
clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it. 

"Clear a path, please," shouted Ford again. "Everything's under 
proper scientific control." 

"He said you'd pay," said the taxi-driver to Arthur, who dug out 
some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police 
sirens. 

"Move along there," shouted Ford, "and no one will get hurt." 

The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they 
pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the 
rubble towards the ramp. 

"It's all right," Ford continued to bellow. "There's nothing to see, 
it's all over. None of this is actually happening." 

"Clear the way, please," boomed a police megaphone from the 
back of the crowd. "There's been a break-in, clear the way." 

"Breakthrough," yelled Ford in competition. "A scientific 
breakthrough!" 

"This is the police! Clear the way!" 

"Scientific equipment! Clear the way!" 

"Police! Let us through!" 



"Walkmen!" yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape 
players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The 
resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the 
supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on to 
the lip of it. 

"Hold tight," muttered Ford, and released a button on his 
Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and bega 
slowly to heave its way upwards. 

"Ok, kids," he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath 
them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into 
the bowels of the ship, "looks like we're on our way." 



Chapter 39 


Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound 
of gunfire. 

Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to 
sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which 
they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself 
down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 

They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits buzzed 
annoyingly. 

This wasn't it, though. 

He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past 
him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging 
against the walls like a confused bee as it did so. 

That wasn't it either. 

He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a 
larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he 
walked towards the other. 

He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate 
of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 

"Would you turn it down please?" he said to Ford Prefect who was 
crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video 
equipment he'd taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, 
having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of 
empty beer cans. 

"Shhhh!" hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the 
screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven. 

"Just a bit," said Arthur. 

"No!" shouted Ford. "We're just getting to the good bit! Listen, I 
finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, 
and this is the good bit!" 



With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and 
watched the good bit. He listened to Ford's whoops and yells and 
"yeehay!"s as placidly as he could. 

"Ford," he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was 
hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, "how 
come, if..." 

"This is the big one," said Ford. "This is the one I came back for. Do 
you realize I never saw it all through? Always I missed the end. I saw 
half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew 
the place up I thought I'd never get to see it. Hey, what happened 
with all that anyway?" 

"Just life," said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack. 

"Oh, that again," said Ford. "I thought it might be something like 
that. I prefer this stuff," he said as Rick's Bar flickered on to the screen. 
"How come if what?" 

"What?" 

"You started to say, 'how come if...'" 

"How come if you're so rude about the Earth, that you... oh never 
mind, let's just watch the movie." 


"Exactly," said Ford. 



Chapter 40 


There remains little still to tell. 

Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of 
Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered 
lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine. Within 
the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, 
around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn in which is the land of 
Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur 
and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey. 

And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain 
of Rars, which was bounded on the South side by the Quentulus 
Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which, according to the 
dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty-foot-high letters of fire 
God's Final Message to His Creation. 

According to Prak, if Arthur's memory saved him right, the place 
was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, 
it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them 
a ticket. 

"Keep to the left, please," he said, "keep to the left," and hurried 
on past them on a little scooter. 

They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path 
that led around the left of the Great Plain was well-worn and dotted 
with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been 
baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was heated by the 
fire of the letters that formed God's Final Message to His Creation. At 
another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred 
with an airbrush, "so as not to spoil the Big Surprise!" it said on the 
reverse. 

"Do you know what the message is?" they asked the wizened little 
lady in the booth. 

"Oh yes," she piped cheerily, "oh yes!" 

She waved them on. 



Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers 
and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun 
baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled 
in the heat. 

"Is it possible," asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, "to rent 
one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had." 

"The scooters," said the little lady who was serving at an ice cream 
bar, "are not for the devout." 

"Oh well, that's easy then," said Fenchurch, "we're not particularly 
devout. We're just interested." 

"Then you must turn back now," said the little lady severely, and 
when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats 
and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each 
other on the Great Red Plain of Rars. 

They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then 
trudged out into the sun again. 

"We're running out of border cream," said Fenchurch after a few 
more miles. "We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the 
previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps 
again." 

They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat 
haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on. 

They then discovered that they were not only not the first ones to 
make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it 
now. 

Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself 
wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half-limping, 
half-crawling. 

It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the 
creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and 
twisted metal. 

It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot dry 
dust. 

"So much time," it groaned, "oh so much time. And pain as well, so 
much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the other 
on its own I could probably manage. It's the two together that really 
get me down. Oh hello, you again." 



"Marvin?" said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. "Is that 
you?" 

"You were always one," groaned the aged husk of the robot, "for 
the super-intelligent question, weren't you?" 

"What is it?" whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind 
Arthur, and grasping on to his arm. "He's sort of an old friend," said 
Arthur. "I..." 

"Friend!" croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a 
kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mouth. "You'll have to 
excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My 
memory banks are not what they were you know, and any word 
which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down 
into auxiliary memory back-up. Ah, here it comes." 

The robot's battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought. 

"Hmm," he said, "what a curious concept." 

He thought a little longer. 

"No," he said at last, "don't think I ever came across one of those. 
Sorry, can't help you there." 

He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, an then tried to 
twist himself up on his misshapen elbows. 

"Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you 
perhaps?" he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. "A piece of paper that 
perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would 
like me," he continued, "to open a door?" 

His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to 
scan the distant horizon. 

"Don't seem to be any doors around at present," he said, "but I'm 
sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And 
then," he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, "I 
could open it for you. I'm quite used to waiting you know." 

"Arthur," hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, "you never told me of 
this. What have you done to this poor creature?" 

"Nothing," insisted Arthur sadly, "he's always like this..." 

"Ha!" snapped Marvin. "Ha!" he repeated. "What do you know of 
always? You say 'always' to me, who, because of the silly little errands 
your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now 



thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words 
with a little more care," he coughed, "and tact." 

He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed. 

"Leave me," he said, "go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully 
on my way. My time at last has nearly come. My race is nearly run. I 
fully expect," he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, "to 
come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size..." 

Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and 
insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he 
weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms. 

They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left 
of the Great Red Plain of Rars toward the encircling mountains of 
Quentulus Quazgar. 

Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often 
interrupted by Marvin's dolorous cybernetic ravings. 

They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of 
the booths, but Marvin would have none of it. 

"I'm all spare parts," he droned. 

"Let me be!" he groaned. 

"Every part of me," he moaned, "has been replaced at least fifty 
times... except..." He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a 
moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory. 
"Do you remember, the first time you ever met me," he said at last to 
Arthur. "I had been given the intellect-stretching task of taking you up 
to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the 
diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced 
but they never were?" 

He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on 
between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to 
move, let alone set. 

"See if you can guess," said Marvin, when he judged that the pause 
had become embarrassing enough, "which parts of me were never 
replaced? Go on, see if you can guess. 

"Ouch," he added, "ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch." 

At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down Marvin 
between them and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some 
cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little polished 



pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar 
Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which was 
written God's Final Message to His Creation. 

Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the 
counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message. 

"Ready?" he said to Fenchurch, who nodded. 

They heaved up Marvin between them. 

They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and 
there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the 
Mountain. There was a little observation vantage point with a rail 
built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a 
good view. It had a little pay-telescope for looking at the letters in 
detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with 
the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a 
telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve. 

They gazed at God's Final Message in wonderment, and were 
slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and 
complete understanding. 

Fenchurch sighed. "Yes," she said, "that was it." 

They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they 
became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in 
difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the 
message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision 
circuits had almost gone. 

They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained 
and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter 
in turn. The first letter was a "w", the second an "e". Then there was a 
gap. An "a" followed, then a "p", an "o" and an "I". 

Marvin paused for a rest. 

After a few moments they resumed and let him see the "o", the "g" 
the "i", the "s" and the "e". 

The next two words were "for" and "the". The last one was a long 
one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it. 

It started with an "i", then "n" then a "c". Next came an "o" and an 
"n", followed by a "v", an "e", another "n" and an "i". 

After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch 



He read the "e", the "n", the "c" and at last the final "e", and 
staggered back into their arms. 

"I think," he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding 
rattling thorax, "I feel good about it." 

The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever. 

Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters 
from guys with green wings. 



Epilogue 


One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who 
couldn't keep his mind on the job in hand. 

Brilliant? 

Certainly. 

One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other 
generation, including a number he had designed himself? 

Without a doubt. 

The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he 
shouldn't be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now. 

He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition. 

So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a 
distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart 
Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly 
relevant, but quite interesting because - never mind, that was his 
name and we can talk about why it's interesting later), was sent into 
guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to 
design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the 
feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, "Concentrate!" 

So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and 
designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little 
distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in 
orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of 
super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open 
half of a half-open window, and also an off-switch for children. 
Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to 
be shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were 
landing. But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most 
warlike races were only on the rampage because they couldn't cope 
with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald's extraordinary 
breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed 
upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a 



programme of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of 
normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned 
lived happily ever after. 

There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the 
chronicler's mind. 



DOUGLAS ADAMS 


YOUNG ZAPHOD PLAYS IT 

SAFE 


A large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an 
astoundingly beautiful sea. From mid-morning onward it plied back 
and forth in great widening arcs, and at last attracted the attention of 
the local islanders' a peaceful, sea-food-loving people who gathered 
on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun, trying to see what 
was there. 

Any sophisticated knowledgeable person, who had knocked about, 
seen a few things, would probably have remarked on how much the 
craft looked like a filing cabinet - a large and recently burgled filing 
cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying. 

The islanders, whose experience was of a different kind, were 
instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster. 

They chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws, its stiff 
unbending back, and the fact that it seemed to experience the 
greatest difficulty staying on the ground. This last feature seemed 
particularly funny to them. They jumped up and down on the spot a 
lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found 
staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world. 

But soon this entertainment began to pall for them. After all, since 
it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster, and 
since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were 
lobsters (a good half dozen of which were now marching succulently 
up the beach toward them), they saw no reason to waste any more 
time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a 
late lobster lunch. 

At that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in mid-air, then 
upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great 
crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees. 



When they reemerged, nervously, a few minutes later, all they 
were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few 
gulping bubbles. 

That's odd, they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best 
lobster to be had anywhere in the Western Galaxy, that's the second 
time that's happened in a year. 


The craft which wasn't a lobster dived direct to a depth of two 
hundred feet, and hung there in the heavy blueness, while vast 
masses of water swayed about it. High above, where the water was 
magically clear, a brilliant formation of fish flashed away. Below, 
where the light had difficulty reaching, the color of the water sank to 
a dark and savage. 

Here, at two hundred feet, the sun streamed feebly. A large, silk¬ 
skinned sea-mammal rolled idly by, inspecting the craft with a kind of 
half interest, as if it had half expected to find something of this kind 
around about here, and then it slid on up and away toward the 
rippling light. 

The craft waited for a minute or two, taking readings, and then 
descended another hundred feet. At this depth it was becoming 
seriously dark. After a moment or two the internal lights of the craft 
shut down, an 

in the second or so that passed before the main external beams 
suddenly; stabbed out, the only visible light came from a small hazily 
illuminated pink sign which read The Beeblebrox Salvage and Really 
Wild Stuff Corporation. 

The huge beams switched downward, catching a vast shoal of silver 
fish which swiveled away in silent panic. 

In the dim control room, which extended in a broad bow from the 
craft's blunt prow, four heads were gathered around a computer 
display that was analyzing the very, very faint and intermittent signals 
that emanated from deep on the sea bed. 

"That's it," said the owner of one of the heads finally. 

"Can we be quite sure?" said the owner of another of the heads. 

"One hundred percent positive," replied the owner of the first head. 



"You're one hundred percent positive that the ship which is 
crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you 
were one hundred percent positive could one hundred percent 
positively never crash?" said the owner of the two remaining heads. 
"Hey," he put up two of his hands, "I'm only asking." 

The two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration responded to this with a very cold stare, but the man 
with the odd, or rather the even, number of heads missed it. He flung 
himself back on the pilot couch, opened a couple of beers - one for 
himself and the other also for himself - stuck his feet on the console 
and said "Hey, baby" through the ultra-glass at a passing fish. 

"Mr. Beeblebrox..." began the shorter and less reassuring of the 
two officials in a low voice. 

"Yup?" said Zaphod, rapping a suddenly empty can down on some 
of the more sensitive instruments. "You ready to dive; Let's go." 

"Mr. Beeblebrox, let us make one thing perfectly clear..." 

"Yeah let's," said Zaphod. "How about this for a start. Why don't 
you just tell me what's really on this ship." 

"We have told you," said the official. "By-products." 

Zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself. 

"By-products," he said. "By-products of what?" 

"Processes," said the official. 

"What processes?" 

"Processes that are perfectly safe." 

"Santa Zarquana Voostra!" exclaimed both of Zaphod's heads in 
chorus. "So safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to take 
the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in! Only it 
doesn't get there because the pilot takes a detour - is this right? - to 
pick up some lobster...? OK, so the guy is cool, but... I mean own up, 
this is barking time, this is major lunch, this is stool approaching 
critical mass, this is... this is... total vocabulary failure!" 

"Shut up!" his right head yelled at his left, "we're flanging!" 

He got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can. 

"Listen, guys," he resumed after a moment's peace and 
contemplation. The two officials had said nothing. Conversation at 
this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire. "I 



just want to know," insisted Zaphod, "what you're getting me into 
here." 

He stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the 
computer screen. They meant nothing to him but he didn't like the 
look of them at all. They were all squiggly with lots of long numbers 
and things. 

"It's breaking up, is that it?" he shouted. "It's got a hold full of 
epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something that'll fry this whole space 
sector for zillions of years back and it's breaking up. Is that the story? 

Is that what we're going down to find? Am I going to come out of that 
wreck with even more heads?" 

"It cannot possibly be a wreck, Mr. Beeblebrox," insisted the official, 
"the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe. It cannot possibly break 
up." 

"Then why are you so keen to go and look at it?" 

"We like to look at things that are perfectly safe." 

"Freeeooow!" 

"Mr. Beeblebrox," said the official, patiently, "may I remind you 
that you have a job to do?" 

"Yeah, well, maybe I don't feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden. 
What do you think I am, completely without any moral whatsits, what 
are they called, those moral things?" 

"Scruples?" 

"Scruples, thank you, whatsoever? Well?" 

The two officials waited calmly. They coughed slightly to help pass 
the time. 

Zaphod sighed a "what is the world coming to" sort of sigh to 
absolve himself from all blame, and swung himself around in his seat. 

"Ship?" he called. 

"Yup?" said the ship. 

"Do what I do." 

The ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then, after 
double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads, it began 
slowly, inexorably, in the hazy blaze of its lights, to sink to the lowest 
depths. 



Five hundred feet. 

A thousand. 

Two thousand. 

Here, at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres, in the chilling 
depths where no light reaches, nature keeps its most heated 
imaginings. Two foo6: long nightmares loomed wildly into the 
bleaching light, yawned, and vanished back into the blackness. 

Two and a half thousand feet. 

At the dim edges of the ship's lights guilty secrets flitted by with 
their eyes on stalks. 

Gradually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed 
resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays 
until as last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct 
from its surroundings. It was like a huge lopsided cylindrical fortress 
that widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the 
heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad, and 
which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most 
secure and impregnable spaceship ever built. Before launch the 
material structure of this section had been battered, rammed, blasted 
and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in 
order to demonstrate that it could withstand them. 

The tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became 
dear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two. 

"In fact it's perfectly safe," said one of the officials, "it's built so 
that even if the ship does break up, the storage holds cannot possibly 
be breached." 


Three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-five feet. 

Four Hi-Presh-A Smart Suits moved slowly out of the open 
hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its 
lights toward the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea 
night. They moved with a sort of clumsy grace, near weightlessness 
though weighed on by a world of water. 

With his right-hand head Zaphod peered up into the black 
immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent 



roar of horror. He glanced to his left and was relieved to see that his 
other head was busy watching the Brockian Ultra-Cricket broadcasts 
on the helmet vid without concern. Slightly behind him to his left 
walked the two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration, slightly in front of him to his right walked the empty 
suit, carrying their implements and testing the way for them. 

They passed the huge rift in the broken backed Starship Billion Year 
Bunker, and played their flashlights up into it. Mangled machinery 
loomed between torn and twisted bulkheads, two feet thick. A family 
of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it. 

The empty suit preceded them along the length of the ship's 
gigantic murky hull, trying the airlocks. The third one it tested ground 
open uneasily. They crowded inside it and waited for several long 
minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure 
that the ocean exerted, and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous 
pressure of air and inert gases. At last the inner door slid open and 
they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the Starship Billion 
Year Bunker. 

Several more high security Titan-O-Hold doors had to be passed 
through, each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark 
keys. Soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the 
UltraCricket broadcasts were beginning to fade, and Zaphod had to 
switch to one of the rock video stations, since there was nowhere that 
they were not able to reach. 

A final doorway slid open, and they emerged into a large sepulchral 
space. Zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell 
full on a wild-eyed screaming face. 

Zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself, dropped his light and 
sat heavily on the floor, or rather on a body which had been lying 
there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being 
sat on by exploding with great violence. Zaphod wondered what to do 
about all this, and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that 
passing out would be the very thing. 

He came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he 
was, where he was or how he had got there, but was nor able to 
convince anybody. He then pretended that his memory suddenly 
retuned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again, 
but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit - which he 



was beginning to take a serious dislike to - and forced to come to 
terms with his surroundings: 

They were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of 
respects, the most obvious of which was the colorful arrangement of 
parts of the ship's late lamented Navigation Officer over the floor, 
walls and ceiling, and especially over the lower half of his, Zaphod's, 
suit. The effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be 
referring to it again at any point in this narrative - other than to 
record briefly the fact that it caused Zaphod to throw up inside his 
suit, which he therefore removed and swapped, after suitable 
headgear modifications, with the empty one. Unfortunately the 
stench of the fetid air in the ship, followed by the sight of his own suit 
walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to 
make him throw up in the other suit as well, which was a problem 
that he and the suit would simply have to live with. 

There. All done. No more nastiness. 

At least, no more of that particular nastiness. 

The owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly 
now and was babbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow 
liquid- 

emergency suspension tank. 

"It was crazy," he babbled, "crazy! I told him we could always try 
the lobster on the way back, but he was crazy. Obsessed! Do you ever 
get like that about lobster? Because I don't. Seems to me it's all 
rubbery and fiddly to eat, and not that much taste, well I mean is 
there? I infinitely prefer scallops, and said so. Oh Zarquon, I said so!" 

Zaphod stared at this extraordinary apparition, flailing in its tank. 
The man was attached to all kinds of life-support tubes, and his voice 
was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely around the ship, 
returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors. 

"That was where I went wrong," the madman yelled, "I actually 
said that I preferred scallops and he said it was because I hadn't had 
real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from, which was 
here, and he'd prove it. He said it was no problem, he said the lobster 
here was worth a whole journey, let alone the small diversion it 
would take to get here, and he swore he could handle the ship in the 
atmosphere, but it was madness, madness!" he screamed, and 
paused with his eyes rolling, as if the word had rung some kind of bell 



in his mind. "The ship went right out of control! I couldn't believe 
what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is 
really so overrated as a food, I'm sorry to go on about lobsters so 
much. I'll try and stop in a minute, but they've been on my mind so 
much for the months I've been in this tank, can you imagine what it's 
like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk 
food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six 
months floating by yourself in a tank thinking about it. I promise I will 
try and shut up about the lobsters, I really will. Lobsters, lobsters, 
lobsters - enough! I think I'm the only survivor. I'm the only one who 
managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down. I sent 
out the Mayday and then we hit. It's a disaster, isn't it? A total 
disaster, and all because the guy liked lobsters. How much sense am I 
making? It's really hard for me to tell." 

He gazed at them beseechingly, and his mind seemed to sway 
slowly back down to earth like a falling leaf. He blinked and looked at 
them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish. He scrabbled 
curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank. 
Tiny, thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and 
nose, caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upward. 

"Oh Zarquon, oh heavens," he mumbled pathetically to himself, 
"I've been found. I've been rescued...." 

"Well," said one of the officials, briskly,"you've been found at 
least." He strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the 
chamber and started checking quickly through the ship's main 
monitor circuits for damage reports. 

"The aorist rod chambers are intact," he said. 

"Holy dingo's dos," snarled Zaphod, "there are aorist rods on 
board...!" 

Aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of 
energy production. When the hunt for new sources of energy had at 
one point got particularly frantic, one bright young chap suddenly 
spotted that one place which had never used up all its available 
energy - the past. And with the sudden rush of blood to the head that 
such insights tend to induce, he invented a way of mining it that very 
same night, and within a year huge tracts of the past were being 
drained of all their energy and simply wasting away Those who 
claimed that the past should be left unspoiled were accused of 



indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality. The past 
provided a very cheap, plentiful and clean source of energy, there 
could always be a few Natural Past Reserves set up if anyone wanted 
to pay for their upkeep, and as for the claim that draining the past 
impoverished the present, well, maybe it did, slightly, but the effects 
were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of proportion. 

It was only when it was realized that the present really was being 
impoverished, and that the reason for it was that those selfish 
plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the 
same thing, that everyone realized that every single aorist rod, and 
the terrible secret of how they were made, would have to be utterly 
and forever destroyed. They claimed it was for the sake of their 
grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the sake of 
their grandparent's grandchildren, and their grandchildren's 
grandparents. 

The official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration 
gave a dismissive shrug. 

"They're perfectly safe," he said. He glanced up at Zaphod and 
suddenly said with uncharacteristic frankness,"There's worse than 
that on board. At least," he added, tapping at one of the computer 
screens, "I hope it's on board." 

The other official rounded on him sharply. 

"What the hell do you think you're saying?" he snapped. 

The first shrugged again. He said, "It doesn't matter. He can say 
what he likes. No one would believe him. It's why we chose to use 
him rather than do anything official, isn't it? The more wild the story 
he tells, the more it'll sound like he's some hippy adventurer making it 
up. He can even say that we said this and it'll make him sound like a 
paranoid." He smile' pleasantly at Zaphod who was seething in his 
nasty suit. "You may accompany us," he told him, "if you wish." 


"You see?" said the official, examining the ultra-titanium outer 
seals of the aorist rod hold. "Perfectly secure, perfectly safe." 

He said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical 
weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire 
planet. 



He said the same thing as they passed holds containing zeta-activq. 
compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole 
planet. 

He said the same thing as they passed holds containing theta-active 
compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a whole 
planet. 

"I'm glad I'm not a planet," muttered Zaphod. 

"You'd have nothing to fear," assured the official from the Safety 
and Civil Reassurance Administration, "planets are very safe. 
Provided," he added - and paused. They were approaching the hold 
nearest to the point where the back of the Starship Billion Year 
Bunker was broken. The corridor here was twisted and deformed, and 
the floor was damp and sticky in patches. 

"Ho hum," he said,"ho very much hum." 

"What's in this hold?" demanded Zaphod. 

"By-products," said the official, clamming up again. 

"By-products...," insisted Zaphod, quietly, "of what?" 

Neither official answered. Instead, they examined the hold door 
very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces 
that had deformed the whole corridor. One of them touched the door 
lightly. It swung open to his touch. There was darkness inside, with 
just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it. 

"Of what?" hissed Zaphod. 

The leading official turned to the other. 

"There's an escape capsule," he said, "that the crew were to use to 
abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole," he said. "I 
think it would be good to know that it's still there." The other official 
nodded and left without a word. 

The first official quietly beckoned Zaphod in. The large dim yellow 
lights glowed about twenty feet from them. 

"The reason," he said, quietly, "why everything else in this ship is, I 
maintain, safe, is that no one is really crazy enough to use them. No 
one. At least no one that crazy would ever get near them. Anyone 
that mad or dangerous rings very deep alarm bells. People may be 
stupid but they're not that stupid." 

"By-products," hissed Zaphod again, he had to hiss in order that his 
voice shouldn't be heard to tremble, "of what." 



"Er, Designer People." 

"What? " 

"The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation was awarded a huge research 
grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order. The 
results were uniformly disastrous. All the 'people' and 'personalities' 
turned out to be amalgams of characteristics that simply could not co¬ 
exist in naturally occurring life forms. Most of them were just poor 
pathetic misfits, but some were deeply, deeply dangerous. Dangerous 
because they didn't ring alarm bells in other people. They could walk 
through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls, because 
no one spotted the danger. 

"The most dangerous of all were three identical ones - they were 
put in this hold, to be blasted, with this ship, right out of this universe. 
They are not evil, in fact they are rather simple and charming. But 
they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there 
is nothing they will not do if allowed, and nothing they will not be 
allowed to do...." 

Zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights, the two dim yellow lights. 
As his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights 
framed a third space where something was broken. Wet sticky 
patches gleamed dully on the floor. 

Zaphod and the official walked cautiously toward the lights. At that 
moment, four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from 
the other official. 

"The capsule is gone," he said tersely. 

"Trace it," snapped Zaphod's companion. "Find exactly where it has 
gone. We must know where it has gone!" 

Zaphod slid aside a large ground-glass door. Beyond it lay a tank 
full of thick yellow liquid, and floating in it was a man, a kindly looking 
man with lots of pleasant laugh lines around his face. He seemed to 
be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself. 

Another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset. 
The planet toward which the escape capsule had headed had already 
been identified. It was in Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. 

The kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to 
himself, just as the co-pilot had been in his tank. Little yellow bubbles 
beaded on the man's lips. Zaphod found a small speaker by the tank 



and turned it on. He heard the man babbling gently about a shining 
city on a hill. 

He also heard the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration issue instructions that the planet in ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha 
must be made "perfectly safe."

MOSTLY HARMLESS 


For Ron 

With grateful thanks to Sue Freestone and Michael Bywater for 
their support, help and the constructive abuse. 

Anything that happens, happens. 


Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, 
causes something else to happen. 


Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens 
again. 


It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though. 



Chapter 1 


The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of 
reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have 
got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things 
have been happening anyway. 

One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the 
difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing travels 
faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, 
which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel people of 
Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by 
bad news but they didn't work particularly well and were so 
extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there 
wasn't really any point in being there. 

So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish in 
their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself was, for a 
long time, largely cosmological. 

Which is not to say that people weren't trying. They tried sending 
off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but 
these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere. By the time 
they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered 
which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so 
that whatever battles it was that the slower-than-light fleets had 
been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by 
the time they actually got there. 

This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the 
battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd had a 
couple of thousand years sleep, they'd come a long way to do a tough 
job and by Zarquon they were going to do it. 

This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in, 
with battles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues they 
had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these 
muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and 



unravel once time-travel was discovered and battles started pre¬ 
erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose. When the 
Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole planets started turning 
unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the 
University of Maxi Mega Ion finally gave up, closed itself down and 
surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of 
Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years. 

Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that 
no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons 
came from, or exactly what it was they wanted. And this is a pity, 
because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible 
that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted - or at 
least would have had to find a different way to happen. 

Click, hum. 

The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently 
through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breath-taking 
speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion 
distant stars to be moving not at all. It was just one dark speck frozen 
against an infinite granularity of brilliant night. 

On board the ship, everything was as it had been for millennia, 
deeply dark and silent. 

Click, hum. 

At least, almost everything. 

Click, click, hum. 

Click, hum, click, hum, click, hum. 

Click, click, click, click, click, hum. 

Hmmm. 

A low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level 
supervising program deep in the ship's semi-somnolent cyberbrain 
and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum. 

The higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed 
to get, and the low level supervising program said that it couldn't 
remember exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of 
distant satisfied sigh, wasn't it? It didn't know what this hum was. 
Click, hum, click, hum. That was all it was getting. 



The higher level supervising program considered this and didn't like 
it. It asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was 
supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn't 
remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to 
go click, sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without 
fail. It had tried to consult its error look-up table but couldn't find it, 
which was why it had alerted the higher level supervising program to 
the problem. 

The higher level supervising program went to consult one of its 
own look-up tables to find out what the low level supervising program 
was meant to be supervising. 

It couldn't find the look-up table. 

Odd. 

It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried to look up 
the error message in its error message look-up table and couldn't find 
that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went 
through all this again. Then it woke up its sector function supervisor. 

The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It called its 
supervising agent which hit problems too. Within a few millionths of a 
second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for 
centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship. Something, 
somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising 
programs could tell what it was. At every level, vital instructions were 
missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of 
discovering that vital instructions were missing, were also missing. 

Small modules of software-agents-surged through the logical 
pathways, grouping, consulting, re-grouping. They quickly established 
that the ship's memory, all the way back to its central mission module, 
was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could determine what it 
was that had happened. Even the central mission module itself 
seemed to be damaged. 

This made the whole problem very simple to deal with. Replace the 
central mission module. There was another one, a backup, an exact 
duplicate of the original. It had to be physically replaced because, for 
safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original 
and its backup. Once the central mission module was replaced it 
could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in 
every detail, and all would be well. 



Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module 
from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ship's 
logic chamber for installation. 

This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and 
protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity 
of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that all 
procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central mission 
module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage 
chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void. 

This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong. 

Further investigation quickly established what it was that had 
happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The ship 
had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly 
knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment which was 
supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite. The first 
thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned out to be 
impossible, because the ship's sensors couldn't see that there was a 
hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors 
weren't working properly weren't working properly and kept saying 
that the sensors were fine. The ship could only deduce the existence 
of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, 
taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, 
with them. 

The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then 
blanked out completely for a bit. It didn't realise it had blanked out, of 
course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised to see the 
stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped the ship finally 
realised that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take 
some serious decisions. 

It relaxed. 

Then it realised it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions yet 
and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it awoke again it 
sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must 
be. 

It clearly hadn't got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but 
since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or 
how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing. It 



consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from 
the tatters of its central mission module. 

"Your!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! year mission is 
to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, land!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a safe 
distance!!!!!!!!!!., land. 

monitor it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..." 

All of the rest was complete garbage. 

Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on 
those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary 
systems. 

It must also revive all of its crew. 

There was another problem. While the crew was in hibernation, 
the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities and 
their understanding of what they had come to do, had all been 
transferred into the ship's central mission module for safe keeping. 
The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what 
they were doing there. Oh well. 

Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realised that 
its engines were beginning to give out too. 

The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the 
control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply looked to 
land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they 
could find to monitor. 

As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn't 
do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so 
achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the 
Envir-O-Form machinery and LifeSupport-O-Systems they carried with 
them to render it, or at least enough parts of it, habitable. There were 
better planets nearer in, but the ship's Strateej-O-Mat was obviously 
locked into Lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive 
planet and, further-more, would not be gainsaid by anybody other 
than the ship's Chief Strategic Officer. Since everybody on the ship 
had lost their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was 
or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go 
about gainsaying the ship's Strateej-O-Mat. 

As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, 
they hit solid gold. 









Chapter 2 


One of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places it's 
prepared to put up with living. Anywhere it can get some kind of a 
grip, whether it's the intoxicating seas of Santraginus V, where the 
fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind of direction they swim 
in, the fire storms of Frastra where, they say, life begins at 40,000 
degrees, or just burrowing around in the lower intestine of a rat for 
the sheer unadulterated hell of it, life will always find a way of 
hanging on in somewhere. 

It will even live in New York, though it's hard to know why. In the 
winter time the temperature falls well below the legal minimum, or 
rather it would do if anybody had the common sense to set a legal 
minimum. The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred 
character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at 
number 79. 

In the summer it's too darn hot. It's one thing to be the sort of life 
form that thrives on heat and finds, as the Frastrans do, that the 
temperature range between 40,000 and 40,004 is very equable, but 
it's quite another to be the sort of animal that has to wrap itself up in 
lots of other animals at one point in your planet's orbit, and then find, 
half an orbit later, that your skin's bubbling. 

Spring is over-rated. A lot of the inhabitants of New York will honk 
on mightily about the pleasures of spring, but if they actually knew 
the first thing about the pleasures of spring they would know of at 
least five thousand nine hundred and eighty-three better places to 
spend it than New York, and that's just on the same latitude. 

Fall, though, is the worst. Few things are worse than fall in New 
York. Some of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats would 
disagree, but most of the things that live in the lower intestines of 
rats are highly disagreeable anyway, so their opinion can and should 
be discounted. When it's fall in New York, the air smells as if 
someone's been frying goats in it, and if you are keen to breathe, the 
best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building. 



Tricia McMillan loved New York. She kept on telling herself this 
over and over again. The Upper West Side. Yeah. Mid Town. Hey, 
great retail. SoHo. The East Village. Clothes. Books. Sushi. Italian. Delis. 
Yo. 

Movies. Yo also. Tricia had just been to see Woody Allen's new 
movie which was all about the angst of being neurotic in New York. 

He had made one or two other movies that had explored the same 
theme, and Tricia wondered if he had ever considered moving, but 
heard that he had set his face against the idea. So: more movies, she 
guessed. 

Tricia loved New York because loving New York was a good career 
move. It was a good retail move, a good cuisine move, not a good taxi 
move or a great quality of pavement move, but definitely a career 
move that ranked amongst the highest and the best. Tricia was a TV 
anchor person, and New York was where most of the world's TV was 
anchored. Tricia's TV anchoring had been done exclusively in Britain 
up to that point: regional news, then breakfast news, early evening 
news. She would have been called, if the language allowed, a rapidly 
rising anchor, but... hey, this is television, what does it matter? She 
was a rapidly rising anchor. She had what it took: great hair, a 
profound understanding of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to 
understand the world and a tiny secret interior deadness which 
meant she didn't care. Everybody has their moment of great 
opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, 
then everything else in life becomes eerily easy. 

Tricia had only ever missed one opportunity. These days it didn't 
even make her tremble quite so much as it used to think about it. She 
guessed it was that bit of her that had gone dead. 

NBS needed a new anchor. Mo Minetti was leaving the US/AM 
breakfast show to have a baby. She had been offered a mind-bubbling 
amount of money to have it on the show, but she had declined, 
unexpectedly, on grounds of personal privacy and taste. Teams of 
NBS lawyers had sieved through her contract to see if these 
constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluctantly, they had 
to let her go. This was, for them, particularly galling because normally 
"reluctantly letting someone go" was an expression that had its boot 
on quite another foot. 



The word was out that maybe, just maybe, a British accent would 
fit. The hair, the skin tone and the bridgework would have to be up to 
American network standards, but there had been a lot of British 
accents up there thanking their mothers for their Oscars, a lot of 
British accents singing on Broadway, and some unusually big 
audiences tuning in to British accents in wigs on Masterpiece Theatre. 
British accents were telling jokes on David Letterman and Jay Leno. 
Nobody understood the jokes but they were really responding to the 
accents, so maybe it was time, just maybe. A British accent on US/AM. 
Well, hell. 

That was why Tricia was here. This was why loving New York was a 
great career move. 

It wasn't, of course, the stated reason. Her TV company back in the 
UK would hardly have stumped up the air fare and hotel bill for her to 
go job hunting in Manhattan. Since she was chasing something like 
ten times her present salary, they might have felt that she could have 
forked out her own expenses, but she'd found a story, found a pretext, 
kept very quiet about anything ulterior, and they'd stumped up for 
the trip. A business class ticket, of course, but her face was known 
and she'd smiled herself an upgrade. The right moves had got her a 
nice room at the Brentwood and here she was, wondering what to do 
next. 

The word on the street was one thing, making contact was another. 
She had a couple of names, a couple of numbers, but all it took was 
being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times and she was back 
at square one. She'd put out feelers, left messages, but so far none 
had been returned. The actual job she had come to do she had done 
in a morning; the imagined job she was after was only shimmering 
tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon. 

Shit. 

She caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the Brentwood. 
The cab couldn't get close to the kerb because a big stretch limo was 
hogging all the available space and she had to squeeze her way past it. 
She walked out of the fetid, goat-frying air and into the blessed cool 
of the lobby. The fine cotton of her blouse was sticking like grime to 
her skin. Her hair felt as if she'd bought it at a fairground on a stick. At 
the front desk she asked if there were any messages, grimly expecting 
none. There was one. 



Oh... 

Good. 

It had worked. She had gone out to the movie specifically in order 
to make the phone ring. She couldn't bear sitting in a hotel room 
waiting. 

She wondered. Should she open the message down here? Her 
clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on 
the bed. She had turned the air conditioning way down to its bottom 
temperature setting, way up to its top fan setting. What she wanted 
more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose 
pimples. Then a hot shower, then a cool one, then lying on a towel, 
on the bed again, drying in the air conditioning. Then reading the 
message. Maybe more goose pimples. Maybe all sorts of things. 

No. What she wanted more than anything else in the world was a 
job in American television at ten times her current salary. More than 
anything else in the world. In the world. What she wanted more than 
anything else at all was no longer a live issue. 

She sat on a chair in the lobby, under a kentia palm, and opened 
the little cellophane-windowed envelope. 

"Please call," it said. "Not happy," and gave a number. The name 
was Gail Andrews. 

Gail Andrews. 

It wasn't a name she was expecting. It caught her unawares. She 
recognised it, but couldn't immediately say why. Was she Andy 
Martin's secretary? Hilary Bass's assistant? Martin and Bass were the 
two major contact calls she had made, or tried to make, at NBS. And 
what did "Not happy" mean? 

"Not happy?" 

She was completely bewildered. Was this Woody Allen trying to 
contact her under an assumed name? It was a 212 area code number. 
So it was someone in New York. Who was not happy. Well, that 
narrowed it down a bit, didn't it? 

She went back to the receptionist at the desk. 

"I have a problem with this message you just gave me," she said. 
"Someone I don't know has tried to call me and says she's not happy." 

The receptionist peered at the note with a frown. 

"Do you know this person?" he said. 



"No," Tricia said. 

"Hmmm," said the receptionist. "Sounds like she's not happy about 
something." 

"Yes," said Tricia. 

"Looks like there's a name here," said the receptionist. "Gail 
Andrews. Do you know anybody of that name?" 

"No," said Tricia. 

"Any idea what she's unhappy about?" 

"No," said Tricia. 

"Have you called the number? There's a number here." 

"No," said Tricia, "you only just gave me the note. I'm just trying to 
get some more information before I ring back. Perhaps I could talk to 
the person who took the call?" 

"Hmmm," said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully. "I 
don't think we have anybody called Gail Andrews here." 

"No, I realise that," said Tricia. "I just - " 

"I'm Gail Andrews." 

The voice came from behind Tricia. She turned round. 

"I'm sorry?" 

"I'm Gail Andrews. You interviewed me this morning." 

"Oh. Oh good heavens yes," said Tricia, slightly flustered. 

"I left the message for you a few hours ago. I hadn't heard so I 
came by. I didn't want to miss you." 

"Oh. No. Of course," said Tricia, trying hard to get up to speed. 

"I don't know about this," said the receptionist, for whom speed 
was not an issue. "Would you like me to try this number for you 
now?" 

"No, that'll be fine, thanks," said Tricia. "I can handle it now." 

"I can call this room number here for you if that'll help," said the 
receptionist, peering at the note again. 

"No, that won't be necessary, thanks," said Tricia. "That's my own 
room number. I'm the one the message was for. I think we've sorted 
this out now." 

"You have a nice day now," said the receptionist. 

Tricia didn't particularly want to have a nice day. She was busy. 



She also didn't want to talk to Gail Andrews. She had a very strict 
cut-off point as far as fraternising with the Christians was concerned. 
Her colleagues called her interview subjects Christians and would 
often cross themselves when they saw one walking innocently into 
the studio to face Tricia, particularly if Tricia was smiling warmly and 
showing her teeth. 

She turned and smiled frostily, wondering what to do. 

Gail Andrews was a well-groomed woman in her mid-forties. Her 
clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste, 
but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries. 
She was an astrologer - a famous and, if rumour were true, influential 
astrologer, having allegedly influenced a number of decisions made 
by the late President Hudson, including everything from which flavour 
of cream whip to have on which day of the week, to whether or not to 
bomb Damascus. 

Tricia had savaged her more than somewhat. Not on the grounds 
of whether or not the stories about the President were true, that was 
old hat now. At the time Ms. Andrews had emphatically denied 
advising President Hudson on anything other than personal, spiritual 
or dietary matters, which did not, apparently include the bombing of 
Damascus. ("NOTHING PERSONAL, DAMASCUS!" the tabloids had 
hooted at the time.) 

No, this was a neat topical little angle that Tricia had come up with 
about the whole issue of astrology itself. Ms. Andrews had not been 
entirely ready for it. Tricia, on the other hand, was not entirely ready 
for a re-match in the hotel lobby. What to do? 

"I can wait for you in the bar, if you need a few minutes," said Gail 
Andrews. "But I would like to talk to you, and I'm leaving the city 
tonight." 

She seemed to be slightly anxious about something rather than 
aggrieved or irate. 

"OK," said Tricia. "Give me ten minutes." 

She went up to her room. Apart from anything else, she had so 
little faith in the ability of the guy on the message desk at reception to 
deal with anything as complicated as a message that she wanted to 
be doubly certain that there wasn't a note under the door. It wouldn't 
be the first time that messages at the desk and messages under the 
door had been completely at odds with each other. 



There wasn't one. 

The message light on the phone was flashing though. 

She hit the message button and got the hotel operator. 

"You have a message from Gary Andress," said the operator. 

"Yes?" said Tricia. An unfamiliar name. "What does it say." 

"Not hippy," said the operator. 

"Not what?" said Tricia. 

"Hippy. What it says. Guy says he's not a hippy. I guess he wanted 
you to know that. You want the number?" 

As she started to dictate the number Tricia suddenly realised that 
this was just a garbled version of the message she had already had. 

"OK, OK," she said. "Are there any other messages for me?" 

"Room number?" 

Tricia couldn't work out why the operator should suddenly ask for 
her number this late in the conversation, but gave it to her anyway. 

"Name?" 

"McMillan, Tricia McMillan." Tricia spelt it, patiently. 

"Not Mr. MacManus?" 

"No." 

"No more messages for you." Click. 

Tricia sighed and dialled again. This time she gave her name and 
room number all over again, up front. The operator showed not the 
slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speaking less than 
ten seconds ago. 

"I'm going to be in the bar," Tricia explained. "In the bar. If a phone 
call comes through for me, please would you put it through to me in 
the bar?" 

"Name?" 

They went through it all a couple more times till Tricia was certain 
that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly 
could be. 

She showered, put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup 
with the speed of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a sigh, 
left the room again. 

She had half a mind just to sneak off and hide. 



No. Not really. 

She had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby while 
she was waiting. She looked cool and in charge, and if she could fool 
herself she could fool anybody. 

She was just going to have to tough it out with Gail Andrews. OK, 
she had given her a hard time. Sorry but that's the game we're all in - 
that sort of thing. Ms. Andrews had agreed to do the interview 
because she had a new book out and TV exposure was free publicity. 
But there's no such thing as a free launch. No, she edited that line out 
again. 

What had happened was this: 

Last week astronomers had announced that they had at last 
discovered a tenth planet, out beyond the orbit of Pluto. They had 
been searching for it for years, Guided by certain orbital anomalies in 
the outer planets, and now they'd found it and they were all terribly 
pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for them and so on. The 
planet was named Persephone, but rapidly nicknamed Rupert after 
some astronomer's parrot - there was some tediously heart-warming 
story attached to this - and that was all very wonderful and lovely. 

Tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, 
considerable interest. 

Then, while she had been casting around for a good excuse to go to 
New York at her TV company's expense she had happened to notice a 
press release about Gail Andrews, and her new book. You and Your 
Planets. 

Gail Andrews was not exactly a household name, but the moment 
you mentioned President Hudson, cream whips and the amputation 
of Damascus (the world had moved on from surgical strikes. The 
official term had in fact been "Damascectomy", meaning the "taking 
out" of Damascus), everyone remembered who you meant. 

Tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer. 

Surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space knew 
something about your day that you didn't must take a bit of a knock 
from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there 
that nobody had known about before. 

That must throw a few calculations out, mustn't it? 



What about all those star charts and planetary motions and so? We 
all knew (apparently) what happened when Neptune was in Virgo, 
and so on, but what about when Rupert was rising? Wouldn't the 
whole of astrology have to be rethought? Wouldn't now perhaps be a 
good time to own up that it was all just a load of hogwash and instead 
take up pig-farming, the principles of which were founded on some 
kind of rational basis? If we'd known about Rupert three years ago, 
might President Hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour on 
Thursday rather than Friday? Might Damascus still be standing? That 
sort of thing. 

Gail Andrews had taken it all reasonably well. She was just starting 
to recover from the initial onslaught, when she made the rather 
serious mistake of trying to shake Tricia off by talking smoothly about 
diurnal arcs, right ascensions and some of the more abstruse areas of 
three-dimensional trigonometry. 

To her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to Tricia 
came right back at her with more spin on it than she could cope with. 
Nobody had warned Gail that being a TV bimbo was, for Tricia, her 
second stab at a role in life. Behind her Chanel lip gloss, her coupe 
sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a brain that had 
acquired for itself, in an earlier, abandoned phase of her life, a first 
class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics. 

As she was getting into the elevator Tricia, slightly preoccupied, 
realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to 
duck back out and get it. No. It was probably safer where it was and 
there wasn't anything she particularly needed in it. She let the door 
close behind her. 

Besides, she told herself, taking a deep breath, if life had taught her 
anything it was this: Never go back for your bag. 

As the elevator went down she stared up at the ceiling in a rather 
intent way. Anyone who didn't know Tricia McMillan better would 
have said that that was exactly the way people sometimes stared 
upwards when they were trying to hold back tears. She must have 
been staring at the tiny security video camera mounted up in the 
corner. She marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later, 
and went up to the reception desk again. 



"Now, I'm going to write this out," she said, "because I don't want 
anything to go wrong." 

She wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper, then her 
room number, then "IN THE BAR" and gave it to the receptionist, who 
looked at it. 

"That's in case there's a message for me. OK?" 

The receptionist continued to look at it. 

"You want me to see if she's in her room?" he said. 

Two minutes later, Tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to Gail 
Andrews, who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine. 

"You struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the 
bar rather than demurely at a table," she said. 

This was true, and caught Tricia a little by surprise. 

"Vodka?" said Gail. 

"Yes," said Tricia, suspiciously. She just stopped herself asking, 

"How did you know?" but Gail answered anyway. 

"I asked the barman," she said, with a kindly smile. 

The barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly 
across the glossy mahogany. 

"Thank you," said Tricia, stirring it sharply. 

She didn't know quite what to make out of all this sudden niceness 
and was determined not to be wrong-footed by it. People in New York 
were not nice to each other without reason. 

"Ms. Andrews," she said, firmly, "I'm sorry that you're not happy. I 
know you probably feel I was a bit rough with you this morning, but 
astrology is, after all, just popular entertainment, which is fine. It's 
part of showbiz and it's a part that you have done well out of and 
good luck to you. It's fun. It's not a science though, and it shouldn't be 
mistaken for one. I think that's something we both managed to 
demonstrate very successfully together this morning, while at the 
same time generating some popular entertainment, which is what we 
both do for a living. I'm sorry if you have a problem with that." 

"I'm perfectly happy," said Gail Andrews. 

"Oh," said Tricia, not quite certain what to make of this. "It said in 
your message that you were not happy." 



"No," said Gail Andrews. "I said in my message that I thought you 
were not happy, and I was just wondering why." 

Tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head. She 
blinked. 

"What?" she said quietly. 

"To do with the stars. You seemed very angry and unhappy about 
something to do with stars and planets when we were having our 
discussion, and it's been bothering me, which is why I came to see if 
you were all right." 

Tricia stared at her. "Ms. Andrews - " she started, and then 
realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and 
unhappy and rather undermined the protest she had been trying to 
make. 

"Please call me Gail, if that's OK." 

Tricia just looked bewildered. 

"I know that astrology isn't a science," said Gail. "Of course it isn't. 
It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or, what's that 
strange thing you British play?" 

"Er, cricket? Self-loathing?" 

"Parliamentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there. They 
don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But 
when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to 
happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. In 
astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they 
could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make. 
It's just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of 
that problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, 
the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of 
fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden 
indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the 
piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden. The 
graphite's not important. It's just the means of revealing their 
indentations. So you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy. 
It's just to do with people thinking about people. 

"So when you got so, I don't know, so emotionally focused on stars 
and planets this morning, I began to think, she's not angry about 
astrology, she really is angry and unhappy about actual stars and 



planets. People usually only get that unhappy and angry when they've 
lost something. That's all I could think and I couldn't make any more 
sense of it than that. So I came to see if you were OK." 

Tricia was stunned. 

One part of her brain had already got started on all sorts of stuff. It 
was busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous 
newspaper horoscopes were and the sort of statistical tricks they 
played on people. But gradually it petered out, because it realised 
that the rest of her brain wasn't listening. She had been completely 
stunned. 

She had just been told, by a total stranger, something she'd kept 
completely secret for seventeen years. 

She turned to look at Gail. 

M | n 

She stopped. 

A tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to follow her 
movement. This completely flummoxed her. Most people would not 
have noticed it. It was not designed to be noticed. It was not designed 
to suggest that nowadays even an expensive and elegant hotel in New 
York couldn't be sure that its clientele wasn't suddenly going to pull a 
gun or not wear a tie. But carefully hidden though it was behind the 
vodka, it couldn't deceive the finely honed instinct of a TV anchor 
person, which was to know exactly when a camera was turning to 
look at her. 

"Is something wrong?" asked Gail. 

"No, I... I have to say that you've rather astonished me," said Tricia. 
She decided to ignore the security camera. It was just her imagination 
playing tricks with her because she had television so much on her 
mind today. It wasn't the first time it had happened. A traffic 
monitoring camera, she was convinced, had swung round to follow 
her as she walked past it, and a security camera in Bloomingdales had 
seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying on hats. She 
was obviously going dotty. She had even imagined that a bird in 
Central Park had been peering at her rather intently. 

She decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka. 
Someone was walking round the bar asking people if they were Mr. 
MacManus. 



"OK," she said, suddenly blurting it out. "I don't know how you 
worked it out, but..." 

"I didn't work it out, as you put it. I just listened to what you were 
saying." 

"What I lost, I think, was a whole other life." 

"Everybody does that. Every moment of every day. Every single 
decision we make, every breath we draw, opens some doors and 
closes many others. Most of them we don't notice. Some we do. 
Sounds like you noticed one." 

"Oh yes, I noticed," said Tricia. "All right. Here it is. It's very simple. 
Many years ago I met a guy at a party. He said he was from another 
planet and did I want to go along with him. I said, yes, OK. It was that 
kind of party. I said to him to wait while I went to get my bag and then 
I'd be happy to go off to another planet with him. He said I wouldn't 
need my bag. I said he obviously came from a very backward planet or 
he'd know that a woman always needed to take her bag with her. He 
got a bit impatient, but I wasn't gong to be a complete pushover just 
because he said he was from another planet. 

"I went upstairs. Took me a while to find my bag, and then there 
was someone else in the bathroom. Came down and he was gone." 

Tricia paused. 

"And...?" said Gail. 

"The garden door was open. I went outside. There were lights. 

Some kind of gleaming thing. I was just in time to see it rise up into 
the sky, shoot silently up through the clouds and disappear. That was 
it. End of story. End of one life, beginning of another. But hardly a 
moment of this life goes by that I don't wonder about some other me. 
A me that didn't go back for her bag. I feel like she's out there 
somewhere and I'm walking in her shadow." 

A member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking 
people if they were Mr. Miller. Nobody was. 

"You really think this... person was from another planet?" asked 
Gail. 

"Oh, certainly. There was the spacecraft. Oh, and also he had two 
heads." 

"Two? Didn't anybody else notice?" 

"It was a fancy dress party." 



"I see..." 

"And he had a bird cage over it, of course. With a cloth over the 
cage. Pretended he had a parrot. He tapped on the cage and it did a 
lot of stupid '"Pretty Polly"' stuff and squawking and so on. Then he 
pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with laughter. There 
was another head in there, laughing along with him. It was a worrying 
moment I can tell you." 

"I think you probably did the right thing, dear, don't you?" said Gail. 

"No," said Tricia. "No I don't. And I couldn't carry on doing what I 
was doing either. I was an astrophysicist, you see. You can't be an 
astrophysicist properly if you've actually met someone from another 
planet who's got a second head that pretends to be a parrot. You just 
can't do it. I couldn't at least." 

"I can see it would be hard. And that's probably why you tend to be 
a little hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete 
nonsense." 

"Yes," said Tricia. "I expect you're right. I'm sorry." 

"That's OK." 

"You're the first person I've ever told this, by the way." 

"I wondered. You married?" 

"Er, no. So hard to tell these days isn't it? But you're right to ask 
because that was probably the reason. I came very close a few times, 
mostly because I wanted to have a kid. But every guy ended up asking 
why I was constantly looking over his shoulder. What do you tell 
someone? At one point I even thought I might just go to a sperm bank 
and take pot luck. Have somebody's child at random." 

"You can't seriously do that, can you?" 

Tricia laughed. "Probably not. I never quite went and found out for 
real. Never quite did it. Story of my life. Never quite did the real thing. 
That's why I'm in television I guess. Nothing is real." 

"Excuse me lady, your name Tricia McMillan?" 

Tricia looked round in surprise. There was a man standing there in 
a chauffeur's hat. 

"Yes," she said, instantly pulling herself back together again. 

"Lady, I been looking for you for about an hour. Hotel said they 
didn't have anybody of that name, but I checked back with Mr. 



Martin's office and they said that this was definitely where you 
staying. So I ask again, they still say they never heard of you, so I get 
them to page you anyway and they can't find you. In the end I get the 
office to FAX a picture of you through to the car and have a look 
myself." 

He looked at his watch. 

"May be a bit late now, but do you want to go anyway?" 

Tricia was stunned. 

"Mr. Martin? You mean Andy Martin at NBS?" 

"That's correct, lady. Screen test for US/AM." 

Tricia shot up out of her seat. She couldn't even bear to think of all 
the messages she'd heard for Mr. MacManus and Mr. Miller. 

"Only we have to hurry," said the chauffeur. "As I heard it Mr. 
Martin thinks it might be worth trying a British accent. His boss at the 
network is dead against the idea. That's Mr. Zwingler, and I happen to 
know he's flying out to the coast this evening because I'm the one has 
to pick him up and take him to the airport." 

"OK," said Tricia, "I'm ready. Let's go." 

"OK, lady. It's the big limo out the front." 

Tricia turned back to Gail. "I'm sorry," she said. 

"Go! Go!" said Gail. "And good luck. I've enjoyed meeting you." 

Tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash. 

"Damn," she said. She'd left it upstairs. 

"Drinks are on me," insisted Gail. "Really. It's been very 
interesting." 

Tricia sighed. 

"Look, I'm really sorry about this morning and..." 

"Don't say another word. I'm fine. It's only astrology. It's harmless. 
It's not the end of the world." 

"Thanks." On an impulse Tricia gave her a hug. 

"You got everything?" said the chauffeur. "You don't want to pick 
up your bag or anything?" 

"If there's one thing that life's taught me," said Tricia, "it's never go 
back for your bag." 



Just a little over an hour later, Tricia sat on one of the pair of beds 
in her hotel room. For a few minutes she didn't move. She just stared 
at her bag, which was sitting innocently on top of the other bed. 

In her hand was a note from Gail Andrews, saying, "Don't be too 
disappointed. Do ring if you want to talk about it. If I were you I'd stay 
in at home tomorrow night. Get some rest. But don't mind me, and 
don't worry. It's only astrology. It's not the end of the world. Gail." 

The chauffeur had been dead right. In fact the chauffeur seemed to 
know more about what was going on inside NBS than any other single 
person she had encountered in the organisation. Martin had been 
keen, Zwingler had not. She had had her one shot at proving Martin 
right and she had blown it. 

Oh well. Oh well, oh well, oh well. 

Time to go home. Time to phone the airline and see if she could 
still get the red-eye back to Heathrow, tonight. She reached for the 
big phone directory. 

Oh. First things first. 

She put down the directory again, picked up her handbag, and took 
it through to the bathroom. She put it down and took out the small 
plastic case which held her contact lenses, without which she had 
been unable properly to read either the script or the autocue. 

As she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes she reflected that 
if there was one thing life had taught her it was that there are times 
when you do not go back for your bag and other times when you do. 

It had yet to teach her to distinguish between the two types of 


occasion. 



Chapter 3 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has, in what we laughingly call 
the past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes. 
Very little of this is, however, at all comprehensible to anyone below 
the level of Advanced God, and since it is now well-established that all 
known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second 
after the Universe began rather than, as they usually claimed, the 
previous week, they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it 
is, and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep 
physics at this time. 

One encouraging thing the Guide does have to say on the subject 
of parallel universes is that you don't stand the remotest chance of 
understanding it. You can therefore say "What?" and "Eh?" and even 
go cross-eyed and start to blither if you like without any fear of 
making a fool of yourself. 

The first thing to realise about parallel universes, the Guide says, is 
that they are not parallel. 

It is also important to realise that they are not, strictly speaking, 
universes either, but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little later, 
after you've realised that everything you've realised up to that 
moment is not true. 

The reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not 
actually a thing as such, but is just a way of looking at what is 
technically known as the WSOGMM, or Whole Sort of General Mish 
Mash. The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash doesn't actually exist 
either, but is just the sum total of all the different ways there would 
be of looking at it if it did. 

The reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the sea is 
not parallel. It doesn't mean anything. You can slice the Whole Sort of 
General Mish Mash any way you like and you will generally come up 
with something that someone will call home. 

Please feel free to blither now. 



The Earth with which we are here concerned, because of its 
particular orientation in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash, was 
hit by a neutrino that other Earths were not. 

A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by. 

In fact it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which one 
could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being hit by 
neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the 
size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an unusual nanosecond in 
which the Earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos. 

It all depends on what you mean by "hit", of course, seeing as 
matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all. The chances of a 
neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this 
howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a ball 
bearing at random from a cruising 747 and hitting, say, an egg 
sandwich. 

Anyway, this neutrino hit something. Nothing terribly important in 
the scale of things, you might say. But the problem with saying 
something like that is that you would be talking cross-eyed badger 
spit. Once something actually happens somewhere in something as 
wildly complicated as the Universe, Kevin knows where it will all end 
up - where "Kevin" is any random entity that doesn't know nothin' 
about nothin'. 

This neutrino struck an atom. 

The atom was part of a molecule. The molecule was part of a 
nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was part of a gene. The gene was part of 
a genetic recipe for growing... and so on. The upshot was that a plant 
ended up growing an extra leaf. In Essex. Or what would, after a lot of 
palaver and local difficulties of a geological nature, become Essex. 

The plant was a clover. It threw its weight, or rather its seed, 
around extremely effectively and rapidly became the world's 
dominant type of clover. The precise causal connection between this 
tiny biological happenstance, and a few other minor variations that 
exist in that slice of the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash - such as 
Tricia McMillan failing to leave with Zaphod Beeblebrox, abnormally 
low sales of pecan-flavoured ice-cream and the fact that the Earth on 
which all this occurred did not get demolished by the Vogons to make 
way for a new hyperspace bypass - is currently sitting at number 



4,763,984,132 on the research project priority list at what was once 
the History Department of the University of MaxiMegalon, and no 
one currently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appears to feel 
any sense of urgency about the problem. 



Chapter 4 


Tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her. She 
knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an overnight 
flight going east, when you suddenly have a whole other mysteriously 
threatening day to deal with for which you are not the least bit 
prepared. But still. 

There were marks on her lawn. 

She didn't really care about marks on her lawn very much. Marks 
on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as she was 
concerned. It was Saturday morning. She had just got home from New 
York feeling tired, crabby and paranoid, and all she wanted to do was 
go to bed with the radio on quietly and gradually fall asleep to the 
sound of Ned Sherrin being terribly clever about something. 

But Eric Bartlett was not going to let her get away with not making 
a thorough inspection of the marks. Eric was the old gardener who 
came in from the village on Saturday mornings to poke around at her 
garden with a stick. He didn't believe in people coming in from New 
York first thing in the morning. Didn't hold with it. Went against 
nature. He believed in virtually everything else, though. 

"Probably them space aliens," he said, bending over and prod-ding 
at the edges of the small indentations with his stick. "Hear a lot about 
space aliens these days. I expect it's them." 

"Do you?" said Tricia, looking furtively at her watch. Ten minutes, 
she reckoned. Ten minutes she'd be able to stay standing up. Then 
she would simply keel over, whether she was in her bedroom or still 
out here in the garden. That was if she just had to stand. If she also 
had to nod intelligently and say "Do you?" from time to time, it might 
cut it down to five. 

"Oh yes," said Eric. "They come down here, land on your lawn, and 
then buzz off again, sometimes with your cat. Mrs. Williams at the 
Post Office, her cat - you know the ginger one? - it got abducted by 
space aliens. Course, they brought it back the next day but it were in a 



very odd mood. Kept prowling around all morning, and then falling 
asleep in the afternoon. Used to be the other way round, is the point. 
Sleep in the morning, prowl in the afternoon. Jet lag, you see, from 
being in an interplanetary craft." 

"I see," said Tricia. 

"They dyed it tabby, too, she says. These marks are exactly the sort 
of marks that their landing pods would probably make." 

"You don't think it's the lawn mower?" asked Tricia. 

"If the marks were more round, I'd say, but these are just off-round, 
you see. Altogether more alien in shape." 

"It's just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing up and 
needed fixing or it might start gouging holes in the lawn." 

"I did say that. Miss Tricia, and I stand by what I said. I'm not saying 
it's not the lawn mower for definite, I'm just saying what seems to me 
more likely given the shapes of the holes. They come in over these 
trees, you see, in their landing pods..." 

"Eric...," said Tricia, patiently. 

"Tell you what, though. Miss Tricia," said Eric, "I will take a look at 
the mower, like I meant to last week, and leave you to get on with 
whatever you're wanting to." 

"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia. "I'm going to bed now, in fact. Help 
yourself to anything you want in the kitchen." 

"Thank you, Miss Tricia, and good luck to you," said Eric. He bent 
over and picked something from the lawn. 

"There," he said. "Three-leaf clover. Good luck you see." 

He peered at it closely to check that it was a real three-leaf clover 
and not just a regular four-leaf one that one of the leaves had fallen 
off. "If I were you, though. I'd watch for signs of alien activity in the 
area." He scanned the horizon keenly. "Particularly from over there in 
the Henley direction." 

"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia again. "I will." 

She went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds. In 
the afternoon she got up and prowled around restlessly, not certain 
what to do with the rest of the day, or indeed the rest of her life. She 
spent at least an hour dithering, trying to make up her mind whether 
to head up into town and go to Stavro's for the evening. This was the 
currently fashionable spot for high-flying media people, and seeing a 



few friends there might help her ease herself back into the swing of 
things. She decided at last she would go. It was good. It was fun there. 
She was very fond of Stavro himself, who was a Greek with a German 
father - a fairly odd combination. Tricia had been to the Alpha a 
couple of nights earlier, which was Stavro's original club in New York, 
now run by his brother Karl, who thought of himself as a German with 
a Greek mother. Stavro would be very happy to be told that Karl was 
making a bit of a pig's ear of running the New York club, so Tricia 
would go and make him happy. There was little love lost between 
Stavro and Karl Mueller. 

OK. That's what she would do. 

She then spent another hour dithering about what to wear. At last 
she settled on a smart little black dress she'd got in New York. She 
phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the club that evening, 
and was told that it was closed this evening for a private wedding 
party. 

She thought that trying to live life according to any plan you 
actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from the 
supermarket. You get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in 
the direction you push it and end up just having to buy completely 
different stuff. What do you do with it? What do you do with the 
recipe? She didn't know. 

Anyway, that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn. 



Chapter 5 


She watched it coming in from over the Henley direction with mild 
curiosity at first, wondering what those lights were. Living, as she did, 
not a million miles from Heathrow, she was used to seeing lights in 
the sky. Not usually so late in the evening, or so low, though, which 
was why she was mildly curious. 

When whatever it was began to come closer and closer her 
curiosity began to turn to bemusement. 

"Hmmm," she thought, which was about as far as she could get 
with thinking. She was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged and the 
messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another 
were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up. She left the 
kitchen where she'd been fixing herself a coffee and went to open the 
back door which led out to the garden. She took a deep breath of cool 
evening air, stepped outside and looked up. 

There was something roughly the size of a large camper van parked 
about a hundred feet above her lawn. 

It was really there. Hanging there. Almost silent. 

Something moved deep inside her. 

Her arms dropped slowly down to her side. She didn't notice the 
scalding coffee slopping over her foot. She was hardly breathing as 
slowly, inch by inch, foot by foot, the craft came downwards. Its lights 
were playing softly over the ground as if probing and feeling it. They 
played over her. 

It seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her chance 
again. Had he found her? Had he come back? The craft dropped down 
and down until at last it had settled quietly on her lawn. It didn't look 
exactly like the one she had seen departing all those years ago, she 
thought, but flashing lights in the night sky are hard to resolve into 
clear shapes. 

Silence. 

Then a click and a hum. 



Then another click and another hum. Click hum, click hum. 

A doorway slid open, spilling light towards her across the lawn. 

She waited, tingling. 

A figure stood silhouetted in the light, then another, and another. 

Wide eyes blinked slowly at her. Hands were slowly raised in 
greeting. 

"McMillan?" a voice said at last, a strange, thin voice that managed 
the syllables with difficulty. "Tricia McMillan. Ms. Tricia McMillan?" 

"Yes," said Tricia, almost soundlessly. 

"We have been monitoring you." 

"M... monitoring? Me?" 

"Yes." 

They looked at her for a while, their large eyes moving up and 
down her very slowly. 

"You look smaller in real life," one said at last. 

"What?" said Tricia. 

"Yes." 

"I... I don't understand," said Tricia. She hadn't expected any of this, 
of course, but even for something she hadn't expected to begin with 
it wasn't going the way she expected. At last she said, 

"Are you... are you from... Zaphod?" 

This question seemed to cause a little consternation among the 
three figures. They conferred with each other in some skittering 
language of their own and then turned back to her. 

"We don't think so. Not as far as we know," said one. 

"Where is Zaphod?" said another, looking up into the night sky. 

"I... I don't know, said Tricia, helplessly. 

"Is it far from here? Which direction? We don't know." 

Tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she 
was talking about. Or even what she was talking about. And she had 
no idea what they were talking about. She put her hopes tightly away 
again and snapped her brain back into gear. There was no point in 
being disappointed. She had to wake up to the fact that she had here 
the journalistic scoop of the century. What should she do? Go back 
into the house for a video camera? Wouldn't they just be gone when 



she got back? She was thoroughly confused as to strategy. Keep'em 
talking, she thought. Figure it out later. 

"You've been monitoring... me?" 

"All of you. Everything on your planet. TV. Radio. 
Telecommunications. Computers. Video circuitry. Warehouses." 

"What?" 

"Car parks. Everything. We monitor everything." 

Tricia stared at them. 

"That must be very boring, isn't it?" she blurted out. 

"Yes." 

"So why..." 

"Except..." 

"Yes? Except what?" 

"Game shows. We quite like game shows." 

There was a terribly long silence as Tricia looked at the aliens and 
the aliens looked at her. 

"There's something I would just like to get from indoors," said 
Tricia very deliberately. "Tell you what. Would you, or one of you, like 
to come inside with me and have a look?" 

"Very much," they all said, enthusiastically. All three of them stood, 
slightly awkwardly in her sitting room, as she hurried around picking 
up a video camera, a 35mm camera, a tape recorder, every recording 
medium she could grab hold of. They were all thin and, under 
domestic lighting conditions, a sort of dim purplish green. 

"I really won't be a second, guys," Tricia said, as she rummaged 
through some drawers for spare tapes and films. 

The aliens were looking at the shelves that held her CDs and her 
old records. One of them nudged one of the others very slightly. 

"Look," he said. "Elvis." 

Tricia stopped, and stared at them all over again. 

"You like Elvis?" she said. 

"Yes," they said. 

"Elvis Presley?" 

"Yes." 



She shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff a new 
tape into her video camera. 

"Some of your people," said one of her visitors, hesitantly, "think 
that Elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens." 

"What?" said Tricia. "Has he?" 

"It is possible." 

"Are you telling me that you have kidnapped Elvis?" gasped Tricia. 
She was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her equipment, but 
this was all almost too much for her. 

"No. Not us," said her guests. "Aliens. It is a very interesting 
possibility. We talk of it often." 

"I must get this down," Tricia muttered to herself. She checked her 
video was properly loaded and working now. She pointed the camera 
at them. She didn't put it up to her eye because she didn't want to 
freak them out. But she was sufficiently experienced to be able to 
shoot accurately from the hip. 

"OK," she said. "Now tell me slowly and carefully who you are. You 
first," she said to the one on the left. "What's your name?" 

"I don't know." 

"You don't know." 

"No." 

"I see," said Tricia. "And what about you other two?" 

"We don't know." 

"Good. OK. Perhaps you can tell me where you are from?" 

They shook their heads. 

"You don't know where you're from?" 

They shook their heads again. 

"So," said Tricia. "What are you... er..." 

She was floundering but, being a professional, kept the camera 
steady while she did it. 

"We are on a mission," said one of the aliens. 

"A mission? A mission to do what?" 

"We do not know." 

Still she kept the camera steady. 

"So what are you doing here on Earth, then?" 



"We have come to fetch you." 

Rock steady, rock steady. Could have been on a tripod. She 
wondered if she should be using a tripod, in fact. She wondered that 
because it gave her a moment or two to digest what they had just 
said. No, she thought, hand-held gave her more flexibility. She also 
thought. Help, what am I going to do? 

"Why," she asked, calmly, "have you come to fetch me?" 

"Because we have lost our minds." 

"Excuse me," said Tricia, "I'm going to have to get a tripod." 

They seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing while 
Tricia quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on it. Her face 
was completely immobile, but she did not have the faintest idea what 
was going on or what to think about it. 

"OK," she said, when she was ready. "Why..." 

"We liked your interview with the astrologer." 

"You saw it?" 

"We see everything. We are very interested in astrology. We like it. 
It is very interesting. Not everything is interesting. Astrology is 
interesting. What the stars tell us. What the stars foretell. We could 
do with some information like that." 

"But..." 

Tricia didn't know where to start. 

Own up, she thought. There's no point in trying to second guess 
any of this stuff. 

So she said, "But I don't know anything about astrology." 

"We do." 

"You do?" 

"Yes. We follow our horoscopes. We are very avid. We see all your 
newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with them. But our 
leader says we have a problem." 

"You have a leader?" 

"Yes." 

"What's his name?" 

"We do not know." 



"What does he say his name is, for Christ's sake? Sorry I'll need to 
edit that. What does he say his name is?" 

"He does not know." 

"So how do you all know he's the leader?" 

"He seized control. He said someone has to do something round 
here." 

"Ah!", said Tricia, seizing on a clue. "Where is 'here'?" 

"Rupert." 

"What?" 

"Your people call it Rupert. The tenth planet from your sun. We 
have settled there for many years. It is highly cold and uninteresting 
there. But good for monitoring." 

"Why are you monitoring us?" 

"It is all we know to do." 

"OK," said Tricia. "Right. What is the problem that your leader says 
you have?" 

"Triangulation." 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Astrology is a very precise science. We know this." 

"Well..." said Tricia, then left it at that. 

"But it is precise for you here on Earth." 

"Ye... e... s..." She had a horrible feeling she was getting a vague 
glimmering of something. 

"So when Venus is rising in Capricorn, for instance, that is from 
Earth. How does that work if we are out on Rupert? What if the Earth 
is rising in Capricorn? It is hard for us to know. Amongst the things we 
have forgotten, which we think are many and profound, is 
trigonometry." 

"Let me get this straight," said Tricia. "You want me to come with 
you to... Rupert..." 

"Yes." 

"To recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the 
relative positions of Earth and Rupert?" 

"Yes." 


"Do I get an exclusive?" 



"Yes." 

"I'm your girl," said Tricia, thinking that at the very least she could 
sell it to the National Enquirer. 

As she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest 
limits of the Solar System, the first thing that met her eyes was a bank 
of video monitors across which thousands of images were sweeping. 

A fourth alien was sitting watching them, but was focused on one 
particular screen that held a steady image. It was a replay of the 
impromptu interview which Tricia had just conducted with his three 
colleagues. He looked up when he saw her apprehensively climbing in. 

"Good evening, Ms. McMillan," he said. "Nice camera work." 



Chapter 6 


Ford Prefect hit the ground running. The ground was about three 
inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it so he 
misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground, started 
running too soon, stumbled awkwardly and twisted his ankle. Damn! 
He ran off down the corridor anyway, hobbling slightly. 

All over the building, alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy 
of excitement. He dived for cover behind the usual storage cabinets, 
glanced around to check that he was unseen, and started rapidly to 
fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he needed. 

His ankle, unusually, was hurting like hell. 

The ground was not only three inches further from the ventilation 
shaft than he remembered, it was also on a different planet than he 
remembered, but it was the three inches that had caught him by 
surprise. The offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were 
quite often shifted at very short notice to another planet, for reasons 
of local climate, local hostility, power bills or tax, but they were 
always reconstructed exactly the same way, almost to the very 
molecule. For many of the company's employees, the layout of their 
offices represented the only constant they knew in a severely 
distorted personal universe. 

Something, though, was odd. 

This was not in itself surprising, thought Ford as he pulled out his 
lightweight throwing towel. Virtually everything in his life was, to a 
greater or lesser extent, odd. It was just that this was odd in a slightly 
different way than he was used to things being odd, which was, well, 
strange. He couldn't quite get it into focus immediately. 

He got out his No. 3 gauge prising tool. The alarms were going in 
the same old way that he knew well. There was a kind of music to 
them that he could almost hum along to. That was all very familiar. 
The world outside had been a new one on Ford. He had not been to 



Saquo-Pilia Hensha before, and he had liked it. It had a kind of 
carnival atmosphere to it. 

He took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he had bought 
in a street market. 

He had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on 
Saquo-Pilia Hensha was that the local people were celebrating the 
annual feast of the Assumption of St Antwelm. St Antwelm had been, 
during his lifetime, a great and popular king who had made a great 
and popular assumption. What King Antwelm had assumed was that 
what everybody wanted, all other things being equal, was to be happy 
and enjoy themselves and have the best possible time together. On 
his death he had willed his entire personal fortune to financing an 
annual festival to remind every one of this, with lots of good food and 
dancing and very silly games like Hunt the Wocket. His Assumption 
had been such a brilliantly good one that he was made into a saint for 
it. Not only that, but all the people who had previously been made 
saints for doing things like being stoned to death in a thoroughly 
miserable way or living upside down in barrels of dung were instantly 
demoted and were now thought to be rather embarrassing. 

The familiar H-shaped building of the Hitchhiker's Guide offices 
rose above the outskirts of the city, and Ford Prefect had broken into 
it in the familiar way. He always entered via the ventilation system 
rather than the main lobby because the main lobby was patrolled by 
robots whose job it was to quiz incoming employees about their 
expense accounts. Ford Prefect's expense accounts were notoriously 
complex and difficult affairs and he had found, on the whole, that the 
lobby robots were ill-equipped to understand the arguments he 
wished to put forward in relation to them. He preferred, therefore, to 
make his entrance by another route. 

This meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building, but not 
the one in the accounts department, which was the way that Ford 
preferred it. 

He hunkered down behind the storage cabinet, he licked the 
rubber suction cup of the toy arrow, and then fitted it to the string of 
the bow. 

Within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a small 
melon came flying down the corridor at about waist height, scanning 
left and right for anything unusual as it did so. 



With impeccable timing Ford shot the toy arrow across its path. 

The arrow flew across the corridor and stuck, wobbling, on the 
opposite wall. As it flew, the robot's sensors locked on to it instantly 
and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to follow it, see what 
the hell it was and where it was going. 

This bought Ford one precious second, during which the robot was 
looking in the opposite direction from him. Fie hurled the towel over 
the flying robot and caught it. 

Because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot 
was festooned, it couldn't manoeuvre inside the towel, and it just 
twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face its captor. 

Ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to the 
ground. It was beginning to whine pitifully. With one swift and 
practised movement. Ford reached under the towel with his No. 3 
gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on top of the 
robot which gave access to its logic circuits. 

Now logic is a wonderful thing but it has, as the processes of 
evolution discovered, certain drawbacks. 

Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else 
which thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest way to fool a 
completely logical robot is to feed it the same stimulus sequence over 
and over again so it gets locked in a loop. This was best demonstrated 
by the famous Flerring Sandwich experiments conducted millennia 
ago at MISPWOSO (The MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully 
Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious). 

A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring 
sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole 
experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it 
liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it. 
Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich! I like 
herring sandwiches." 

It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its 
herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again. Unfortunately 
for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of 
straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off 
its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor in front of the robot. 
Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich..., 
etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again. The 



only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored 
with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other 
ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a 
bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally 
less alert to what was going on than was the robot. 

The scientists at the Institute thus discovered the driving force 
behind all change, development and innovation in life, which was this: 
herring sandwiches. They published a paper to this effect, which was 
widely criticised as being extremely stupid. They checked their figures 
and realised that what they had actually discovered was "boredom", 
or rather, the practical function of boredom. In a fever of excitement 
they then went on to discover other emotions, Like "irritability", 
"depression", "reluctance", "ickiness" and so on. The next big 
breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches, 
whereupon a whole welter of new emotions became suddenly 
available to them for study, such as "relief", "joy", "friskiness", 
"appetite", "satisfaction", and most important of all, the desire for 
"happiness". 

This was the biggest breakthrough of all. 

Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behaviour 
in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply. All that 
robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy, and a 
few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those 
states about. They would then work the rest out for themselves. 

The robot which Ford had got trapped under his towel was not, at 
the moment a happy robot. It was happy when it could move about. It 
was happy when it could see other things. It was particularly happy 
when it could see other things moving about, particularly if the other 
things were moving about doing things they shouldn't do because it 
could then, with considerable delight, report them. 

Ford would soon fix that. 

He squatted over the robot and held it between his knees. The 
towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms, but Ford had 
now got its logic circuits exposed. The robot was whirring grungily and 
pettishly, but it could only fidget, it couldn't actually move. Using the 
prising tool. Ford eased a small chip out from its socket. As soon as it 
came out, the robot went quiet and just sat there in a coma. 



The chip Ford had taken out was the one which contained the 
instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for 
the robot to feel happy. The robot would be happy when a tiny 
electrical charge from a point just to the left of the chip reached 
another point just to the right of the chip. The chip determined 
whether the charge got there or not. 

Ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded into 
the towel. Fie dug one end of it into the top left hole of the chip 
socket and the other into the bottom right hole. 

That was all it took. Now the robot would be happy whatever 
happened. 

Ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away. The robot rose 
ecstatically into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly path. 

It turned and saw Ford. 

"Mr. Prefect, sir! I'm so happy to see you!" 

"Good to see you, little fella," said Ford. 

The robot rapidly reported back to its central control that 
everything was now for the best in this best of all possible worlds, the 
alarms rapidly quelled themselves, and life returned to normal. 

At least, almost to normal. 

There was something odd about the place. 

The little robot was gurgling with electric delight. Ford hurried on 
down the corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake telling him 
how delicious everything was, and how happy it was to be able to tell 
him that. 

Ford, however, was not happy. 

Fie passed faces of people he didn't know. They didn't look like his 
sort of people. They were too well groomed. Their eyes were too 
dead. Every time he thought he saw someone he recognised in the 
distance, and hurried along to say hello, it would turn out to be 
someone else, with an altogether neater hairstyle and a much more 
thrusting, purposeful look than, well, than anybody Ford knew. 

A staircase had been moved a few inches to the left. A ceiling had 
been lowered slightly. A Lobby had been remodelled. All these things 
were not worrying in themselves, though they were a little 
disorienting. The thing that was worrying was the decor. It used to be 
brash and glitzy. Expensive - because the Guide sold so well through 



the civilised and post-civilised Galaxy - but expensive and fun. Wild 
games machines lined the corridors. Insanely painted grand pianos 
hung from ceilings, vicious sea creatures from the planet Viv reared 
up out of pools in tree-filled atria, robot butlers in stupid shirts 
roamed the corridors seeking whose hands they might press frothing 
drinks into. People used to have pet vastdragons on leads and 
pterospondes on perches in their offices. People knew how to have a 
good time, and if they didn't there were courses they could sign up 
for which would put that right. 

There was none of that now. 

Somebody had been through the place doing some iniquitous kind 
of taste job on it. 

Ford turned sharply into a small alcove, cupped his hand and 
yanked the flying robot in with him. He squatted down and peered at 
the burbling cybernaut. 

"What's been happening here?" he demanded. 

"Oh just the nicest things, sir, just the nicest possible things. Can I 
sit on your lap, please?" 

"No," said Ford, brushing the thing away. It was overjoyed to be 
spurned in this way and started to bob and burble and swoon. Ford 
grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a foot in front of his face. 
It tried to stay where it was put but couldn't help quivering slightly. 

"Something's changed, hasn't it?" Ford hissed. 

"Oh yes," squealed the little robot, "in the most fabulous and 
wonderful way. I feel so good about it." 

"Well what was it like before, then?" 

"Scrumptious." 

"But you like the way it's changed?" demanded Ford. 

"I like everything," moaned the robot. "Especially when you shout 
at me like that. Do it again, please." 

"Just tell me what's happened!" 

"Oh thank you, thank you!" 

Ford sighed. 

"OK, OK," panted the robot. "The Guide has been taken over. 
There's a new management. It's all so gorgeous I could just melt. The 



old management was also fabulous of course, though I'm not sure if I 
thought so at the time." 

"That was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head." 

"How true. How wonderfully true. How wonderfully, bubblingly, 
frothingly, burstingly true. What a truly ecstasy-inducingly correct 
observation." 

"What's happened?" insisted Ford. "Who is this new management? 
When did they take over? I... oh, never mind," he added, as the little 
robot started to gibbet with uncontrollable joy and rub itself against 
his knee. "I'll go and find out for myself." Ford hurled himself at the 
door of the editor-in-chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as 
the frame splintered and gave way, rolled rapidly across the floor to 
where the drinks trolley laden with some of the Galaxy's most potent 
and expensive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley 
and, using it to give himself cover, trundled it and himself across the 
main exposed part of the office floor to where the valuable and 
extremely rude statue of Leda and the Octopus stood, and took 
shelter behind it. Meanwhile the little security robot, entering at 
chest height, was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from Ford. 

That, at least, was the plan, and a necessary one. The current 
editor-in-chief, Stagyar-zil-Doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man 
who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in his office 
without pages of fresh, proofed copy, and had a battery of laser 
Guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door frame to 
deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good reasons why 
they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of output maintained. 

Unfortunately the drinks trolley wasn't there. 

* * * 

Ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted 
towards the statue of Leda and the Octopus, which also wasn't there. 
He rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random panic, 
tripped, span, hit the window, which fortunately was built to 
withstand rocket attacks, rebounded, and fell in a bruised and winded 
heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa, which hadn't been 
there before. 

After a few seconds he slowly peeked up above the top of the sofa. 
As well as there being no drinks trolley and no Leda and the Octopus, 



there had also been a startling absence of gunfire. He frowned. This 
was all utterly wrong. 

"Mr. Prefect, I assume," said a voice. 

The voice came from a smooth-faced individual behind a large 
ceramo-teak-bonded desk. Stagyar-zil-Doggo may well have been a 
hell of an individual, but no one, for a whole variety of reasons, would 
ever have called him smooth-faced. This was not Stagyar-zil-Doggo. 

"I assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not have 
new material for the, er. Guide, at the moment," said the smooth¬ 
faced individual. He was sitting with his elbows resting on the table 
and holding his fingertips together in a manner which, inexplicably, 
has never been made a capital offence. 

"I've been busy," said Ford, rather weakly. He staggered to his feet, 
brushing himself down. Then he thought, what the hell was he saying 
things weakly for? He had to get on top of this situation. He had to 
find out who the hell this person was, and he suddenly thought of a 
way of doing it. 

"Who the hell are you?", he demanded. 

"lam your new editor-in-chief. That is, if we decide to retain your 
services. My name is Vann Harl." He didn't put his hand out. He just 
added, "What have you done to that security robot?" 

The little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling and 
moaning quietly to itself. 

"I've made it very happy," snapped Ford. "It's a kind of mission I 
have. Where's Stagyar? More to the point, where's his drinks trolley?" 

"Mr. zil-Doggo is no longer with this organisation. His drinks trolley 
is, I imagine, helping to console him for this fact." 

"Organisation?" yelled Ford. "Organisation? What a bloody stupid 
word for a set-up like this!" 

"Precisely our sentiments. Under-structured, overresourced, 
under-managed, over-inebriated. And that," said Harl, "was just the 
editor." 

"I'll do the jokes," snarled Ford. 

"No," said Harl. "You will do the restaurant column." 

He tossed a piece of plastic on to the desk in front of him. Ford did 
not move to pick it up. 



"You what?" said Ford. 

"No. Me Harl. You Prefect. You do restaurant column. Me editor. 
Me sit here tell you do restaurant column. You get?" 

"Restaurant column?" said Ford, too bewildered to be really angry 
yet. 

"Siddown, Prefect," said Harl. Fie swung round in his swivel chair, 
got to his feet, and stood staring out at the tiny specks enjoying the 
carnival twenty-three stories below. 

"Time to get this business on its feet, Prefect," he snapped. 

"We at InfiniDim Enterprises are..." 

"You at what?" 

"InfiniDim Enterprises. We have bought out the Guide." 

"InfiniDim?" 

"We spent millions on that name, Prefect. Start liking it or start 
packing." 

Ford shrugged. Fie had nothing to pack. 

"The Galaxy is changing," said Harl. "We've got to change with it. 
Go with the market. The market is moving up. New aspirations. New 
technology. The future is..." 

"Don't tell me about the future," said Ford. "I've been all over the 
future. Spend half my time there. It's the same as anywhere else. 
Anywhen else. Whatever. Just the same old stuff in faster cars and 
smellier air." 

"That's one future," said Harl. "That's your future, if you accept it. 
You've got to learn to think multi-dimensionally. There are limitless 
futures stretching out in every direction from this moment-and from 
this moment and from this. Billions of them, bifurcating every instant 
Every possible position of every possible electron balloons out into 
billions of probabilities! Billions and billions of shining, gleaming 
futures! You know what that means?" 

"You're dribbling down your chin." 

"Billions and billions of markets!" 

"I see," said Ford. "So you sell billions and billions of Guides." 

"No," said Harl, reaching for his handkerchief and not finding one. 
"Excuse me," he said, "but this gets me so excited." Ford handed him 
his towel. 



"The reason we don't sell billions and billions of Guides," continued 
Harl, after wiping his mouth, "is the expense. What we do is we sell 
one Guide billions and billions of times. We exploit the 
multidimensional nature of the Universe to cut down on 
manufacturing costs. And we don't sell to penniless hitchhikers. What 
a stupid notion that was! Find the one section of the market that, 
more or less by definition, doesn't have any money, and try and sell to 
it. No. We sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing 
wife in a billion, billion different futures. This is the most radical, 
dynamic and thrusting business venture in the entire 
multidimensional infinity of space/time/probability ever." 

"And you want me to be its restaurant critic," said Ford. 

"We would value your input." 

"Kill!" shouted Ford. Fie shouted it at his towel. 

The towel leapt up out of Flarl's hands. 

This was not because it had any motive force of its own, but 
because Flarl was so startled at the idea that it might. The next thing 
that startled him was the sight of Ford Prefect hurtling across the 
desk at him fists first. In fact Ford was just lunging for the credit card, 
but you don't get to occupy the sort of position that Flarl occupied in 
the sort of organisation in which Flarl occupied it without developing 
a healthily paranoid view of life. Fie took the sensible precaution of 
hurling himself backwards, and striking his head a sharp blow on the 
rocket-proof glass, then subsided into a series of worrying and highly 
personal dreams. 

Ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly everything had 
gone. Fie glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his 
hand - it was a Dine-O-Charge credit card with his name already 
embossed on it, and an expiry date two years from now, and was 
possibly the single most exciting thing Ford had ever seen in his life - 
then he clambered over the desk to see to Flarl. 

Fie was breathing fairly easily. It occurred to Ford that he might 
breathe more easily yet without the weight of his wallet bearing 
down on his chest, so he slipped it out of Flarl's breast pocket and 
flipped through it. Fair amount of cash. Credit tokens. Ultragolf club 
membership. Other club memberships. Photos of someone's wife and 
family - presumably Flarl's, but it was hard to be sure these days. 



Busy executives often didn't have time for a full-time wife and family 
and would just rent them for weekends. 

Ha! 

He couldn't believe what he'd just found. 

He slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely exciting 
piece of plastic that was nestling amongst a bunch of receipts. 

It wasn't insanely exciting to look at. It was rather dull in fact. It 
was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and semi¬ 
transparent. If you held it up to the light you could see a lot of 
holographically encoded information and images buried pseudo¬ 
inches deep beneath its surface. 

It was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for 
Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly 
understandable. There were so many different ways in which you 
were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days 
that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor 
alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to 
function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically 
ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash point machines, for 
instance. Queues of people standing around waiting to have their 
fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits of skin scraped from the 
nape of the neck and undergoing instant (or nearly instant - a good 
six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic analysis, then having to 
answer trick questions about members of their family they didn't 
even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences for 
tablecloth colours. And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the 
weekend. If you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile 
treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying. 

Hence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of 
information about you, your body and your life into one all-purpose 
machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your 
wallet, and therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to 
date over both itself and plain common sense. 

Ford pocketed it. A remarkably good idea had just occurred to him. 
He wondered how long Harl would remain unconscious. 

"Hey!" he shouted to the little melon-sized robot still slobbering 
with euphoria up on the ceiling. "You want to stay happy?" 



The robot gurgled that it did. 

"Then stick with me and do everything I tell you without fail." 

The robot said that it was quite happy where it was up on the 
ceiling thank you very much. It had never realised before how much 
sheer titillation there was to be got from a good ceiling and it wanted 
to explore its feelings about ceilings in greater depth. 

"You stay there," said Ford, "and you'll soon be recaptured and 
have your conditional chip replaced. You want to stay happy, come 
now." 

The robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and 
sank reluctantly away from the ceiling. 

"Listen," said Ford, "can you keep the rest of the security system 
happy for a few minutes?" 

"One of the joys of true happiness," trilled the robot, "is sharing. I 
brim, I froth, I overflow with..." 

"OK," said Ford. "Just spread a little happiness around the security 
network. Don't give it any information. Just make it feel good so it 
doesn't feel the need to ask for any." 

Fie picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door. Life had 
been a little dull of late. It showed every sign now of becoming 
extremely froody. 



Chapter 7 


Arthur Dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had 
never before seen a spaceport which had a sign saying, "Even 
travelling despondently is better than arriving here." To welcome 
visitors the arrivals hall featured a picture of the President of 
NowWhat, smiling. It was the only picture anybody could find of him, 
and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself so although 
the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed the smile 
it wore was rather a ghastly one. The side of his head had been drawn 
back in crayon. No replacement had been found for the photograph 
because no replacement had been found for the President. There was 
only one ambition which anyone on the planet ever had, and that was 
to leave. 

Arthur checked himself into a small motel on the outskirts of town, 
and sat glumly on the bed, which was damp, and flipped through the 
little information brochure, which was also damp. It said that the 
planet of NowWhat had been named after the opening words of the 
first settlers to arrive there after struggling across light years of space 
to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches of the Galaxy. The main 
town was called OhWell. There weren't any other towns to speak of. 
Settlement on NowWhat had not been a success and the sort of 
people who actually wanted to live on NowWhat were not the sort of 
people you would want to spend time with. 

Trading was mentioned in the brochure. The main trade that was 
carried out was in the skins of the NowWhattian boghog but it wasn't 
a very successful one because no one in their right minds would want 
to buy a NowWhattian boghog skin. The trade only hung on by its 
fingernails because there was always a significant number of people 
in the Galaxy who were not in their right minds. Arthur had felt very 
uncomfortable looking around at some of the other occupants of the 
small passenger compartment of the ship. 

The brochure described some of the history of the planet. Whoever 
had written it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little 



enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasn't actually cold and 
wet all the time, but could find little positive to add to this so the tone 
of the piece quickly degenerated into savage irony. 

It talked about the early years of settlement. It said that the major 
activities pursued on NowWhat were those of catching, skinning and 
eating NowWhattian boghogs, which were the only extant form of 
animal life on NowWhat, all other having long ago died of despair. 

The boghogs were tiny, vicious creatures, and the small margin by 
which they fell short of being completely inedible was the margin by 
which life on the planet subsisted. So what were the rewards, 
however small, that made life on NowWhat worth living? Well, there 
weren't any. Not a one. Even making yourself some protective 
clothing out of boghog skins was an exercise in disappointment and 
futility, since the skins were unaccountably thin and leaky. This 
caused a lot of puzzled conjecture amongst the settlers. What was the 
boghog's secret of keeping warm? If anyone had ever learnt the 
language the boghogs spoke to each other they would have 
discovered that there was no trick. The boghogs were as cold and wet 
as anyone else on the planet. No one had had the slightest desire to 
learn the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that these 
creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on the thigh. 
Life on NowWhat being what it was, most of what a boghog might 
have to say about it could easily be signified by these means. 

Arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he was 
looking for. At the back there were a few maps of the planet. They 
were fairly rough and ready because they weren't likely to be of much 
interest to anyone, but they told him what he wanted to know. 

He didn't recognise it at first because the maps were the other way 
up from the way he would have expected and looked, therefore 
thoroughly unfamiliar. Of course, up and down, north and south, are 
absolutely arbitrary designations, but we are used to seeing things the 
way we are used to seeing them, and Arthur had to turn the maps 
upside-down to make sense of them. 

There was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand side of 
the page which tapered down to a tiny waist and then ballooned out 
again like a large comma. On the right-hand side was a collection of 
large shapes jumbled familiarly together. The outlines were not 
exactly the same, and Arthur didn't know if this was because the map 



was so rough, or because the sea-level was higher or because, well, 
things were just different here. But the evidence was inarguable. 

This was definitely the Earth. 

Or rather, it most definitely was not. 

It merely looked a lot like the Earth and occupied the same 
coordinates in space/time. What co-ordinates it occupied in 
Probability was anybody's guess. 

He sighed. 

This, he realised, was about as close to home as he was likely to get. 
Which meant that he was about as far from home as he could 
possibly be. Glumly he slapped the brochure shut and wondered what 
on earth he was going to do next. 

He allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just thought. He 
looked at his old watch, and shook it a bit to wind it. It had taken him, 
according to his own time-scale, a year of hard travelling to get here. 

A year since the accident in hyperspace in which Fenchurch had 
completely vanished. One minute she had been sitting there next to 
him in the SlumpJet; the next minute the ship had done a perfectly 
normal hyperspace hop and when he had next looked she was not 
there. The seat wasn't even warm. Her name wasn't even on the 
passenger list. 

The spaceline had been wary of him when he had complained. A lot 
of awkward things happen in space travel, and a lot of them make a 
lot of money for lawyers. But when they had asked him what Galactic 
Sector he and Fenchurch had been from and he had said ZZ9 Plural Z 
Alpha they had relaxed completely in a way that Arthur wasn't at all 
sure he liked. They even laughed a little, though sympathetically, of 
course. They pointed to the clause in the ticket contract which said 
that the entities whose lifespans had originated in any of the Plural 
zones were advised not to travel in hyperspace and did so at their 
own risk. Every-body, they said, knew that. They tittered slightly and 
shook their heads. 

As Arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling slightly. 
Not only had he lost Fenchurch in the most complete and utter way 
possible, but he felt that the more time he spent away out in the 
Galaxy the more it seemed that the number of things he didn't know 
anything about actually increased. 



Just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories a knock 
came on the door of his motel room, which then opened immediately. 
A fat and dishevelled man came in carrying Arthur's one small case. 

He got as far as, "Where shall I put - " when there was a sudden 
violent flurry and he collapsed heavily against the door, trying to beat 
off a small and mangy creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet 
night and buried its teeth in his thigh, even through the thick layers of 
leather padding he wore there. There was a brief, ugly confusion of 
jabbering and thrashing. The man shouted frantically and pointed. 
Arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for 
this purpose and beat at the boghog with it. 

The boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed 
and forlorn. It turned anxiously in the corner of the room, its tail 
tucked up right under its back legs, and stood looking nervously up at 
Arthur, jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one side. Its jaw 
seemed to be dislocated. It cried a little and scraped its damp tail 
across the floor. By the door, the fat man with Arthur's suitcase was 
sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the flow of blood from his thigh. 
His clothes were already wet from the rain. 

Arthur stared at the boghog, not knowing what to do. The boghog 
looked at him questioningly. It tried to approach him, waking 
mournful little whimpering noises. It moved its jaw pain-fully. It made 
a sudden leap for Arthur's thigh, but its dislocated jaw was too weak 
to get a grip and it sank, whining sadly, down to the floor. The fat man 
jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick, beat the boghog's brains into a 
sticky, pulpy mess on the thin carpet, and then stood there breathing 
heavily as if daring the animal to move again, just once. 

A single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at Arthur from 
out of the mashed ruins of its head. 

"What do you think it was trying to say?" asked Arthur in a small 
voice. 

"Ah, nothing much," said the man "Just its way of trying to be 
friendly. This is just our way of being friendly back," he added, 
gripping the stick. 

"When's the next flight out?" asked Arthur. 

"Thought you'd only just arrived," said the man. 



"Yes," said Arthur. "It was only going to be a brief visit. I just 
wanted to see if this was the right place or not. Sorry." 

"You mean you're on the wrong planet?" said the man lugubriously. 
"Funny how many people say that. Specially the people who live 
here." He eyed the remains of the boghog with a deep, ancestral 
resentment. 

"Oh no," said Arthur, "it's the right planet all right." He picked up 
the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in his pocket. "It's OK, 
thanks, I'll take that," he said, taking his case from the man. He went 
to the door and looked out into the cold, wet night. 

"Yes, it's the right planet, all right," he said again. "Right planet, 
wrong universe." 

A single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for 
the spaceport. 



Chapter 8 


Ford had his own code of ethics. It wasn't much of one, but it was 
his and he stuck by it, more or less. One rule he made was never to 
buy his own drinks. He wasn't sure if that counted as an ethic, but you 
have to go with what you've got. He was also firmly and utterly 
opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals whatsoever 
except geese. And furthermore he would never steal from his 
employers. 

Well, not exactly steal. 

If his accounts supervisor didn't start to hyperventilate and put out 
a seal-all-exits security alert when Ford handed in his expenses claim 
then Ford felt he wasn't doing his job properly. But actually stealing 
was another thing. That was biting the hand that feeds you. Sucking 
very hard on it, even nibbling it in an affectionate kind of a way was 
OK, but you didn't actually bite it. Not when that hand was the Guide. 
The Guide was something sacred and special. 

But that, thought Ford as he ducked and weaved his way down 
through the building, was about to change. And they had only 
themselves to blame. Look at all this stuff. Lines of neat grey office 
cubicles and executive workstation pods. The whole place was dreary 
with the hum of memos and minutes of meetings flitting through its 
electronic networks. Out in the street they were playing Hunt the 
Wocket for Zark's sake, but here in the very heart of the Guide offices 
no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or 
wearing inappropriately coloured beachware. 

"InfiniDim Enterprises," Ford snarled to himself as he stalked 
rapidly down one corridor after another. Door after door magically 
opened to him without question. Elevators took him happily to places 
they should not. Ford was trying to pursue the most tangled and 
complicated route he could, heading generally down-wards through 
the building. His happy little robot took care of everything, spreading 
waves of acquiescent joy through all the security circuits it 
encountered. 



Ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it Emily 
Saunders, after a girl he had very fond memories of. Then he thought 
that Emily Saunders was an absurd name for a security robot, and 
decided to call it Colin instead, after Emily's dog. 

He was moving deep into the bowels of the building now, into 
areas he had never entered before, areas of higher and higher 
security. He was beginning to encounter puzzled looks from the 
operatives he passed. At this level of security you didn't even call 
them people anymore. And they were probably doing stuff that only 
operatives would do. When they went home to their families in the 
evening they became people again, and when their little children 
looked up to them with their sweet shining eyes and said "Daddy, 
what did you do all day today?" they just said, "I performed my duties 
as an operative," and left it at that. 

The truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went 
on behind the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the Guide liked to 
put up - or used to like to put up before this new InfiniDim 
Enterprises bunch marched in and started to make the whole thing 
highly dodgy. There were all kinds of tax scams and rackets and graft 
and shady deals supporting the shining edifice, and down in the 
secure research and data-processing levels of the building was where 
it all went on. 

Every few years the Guide would set up its business, and indeed its 
building on a new world, and all would be sunshine and laughter for a 
while as the Guide would put down its roots in the local culture and 
economy, provide employment, a sense of glamour and adventure 
and, in the end, not quite as much actual revenue as the locals had 
expected. 

When the Guide moved on, taking its building with it, it left a little 
like a thief in the night. Exactly like a thief in the night in fact. It 
usually left in the very early hours of the morning, and the following 
day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing. 
Whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake, often 
within a week, leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell¬ 
shocked but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great 
adventure. 

The "operatives" who shot puzzled glances at Ford as he marched 
on into the depths of the building's most sensitive areas were 



reassured by the presence of Colin, who was flying along with him in a 
buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his path for him at every 
stage. 

Alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building. 

Perhaps that meant that Vann Harl had already been discovered, 
which might be a problem. Ford had been hoping he would be able to 
slip the Ident-i-Eeze back into his pocket before he came round. Well, 
that was a problem for later, and he didn't for the moment have the 
faintest idea how he was going to solve it. For the moment he wasn't 
going to worry. Wherever he went with little Colin, he was 
surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light and, most importantly, 
willing and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors. 

Ford even began to whistle, which was probably his mistake. 

Nobody likes a whistler, particularly not the divinity that shapes our 
ends. 

The next door wouldn't open. 

And that was a pity, because it was the very one that Ford had 
been making for. It stood there before him, grey and resolutely closed 
with a sign on it saying: 

NO ADMITTANCE. 

NOT EVEN TO AUTHORISED PERSONNEL. 

YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE. 

GO AWAY. 


Colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot 
grimmer down in these lower reaches of the building. 

They were about ten stories below ground level now. The air was 
refrigerated and the tasteful grey hessian wall-weave had given way 
to brutal grey bolted steel walls. Colin's rampant euphoria had 
subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness. He said that he was 
beginning to tire a little. It was taking all his energy to pump the 
slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors down here. 

Ford kicked at the door. It opened. 

"Mixture of pleasure and pain," he muttered. "Always does the 
trick." 



He walked in and Colin flew in after him. Even with a wire stuck 
straight into his pleasure electrode his happiness was a nervous kind 
of happiness. He bobbed around a little. 

The room was small, grey and humming. 

This was the nerve centre of the entire Guide. 

The computer terminals that lined the grey walls were windows on 
to every aspect of the Guide's operations. Here, on the left-hand side 
of the room, reports were gathered over the Sub-Etha-Net from field 
researchers in every corner of the Galaxy, fed straight up into the 
network of sub-editor's offices where they had all the good bits cut 
out by secretaries because the sub-editors were out having lunch. The 
remaining copy would then be shot across to the other half of the 
building - the other leg of the "H" - which was the legal department. 
The legal department would cut out anything that was still even 
remotely good from what remained and fire it back to the offices of 
the executive editors, who were also out at lunch. So the editors 
secretaries would read it and say it was stupid and cut most of what 
was left. 

When any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they would 
exclaim "What is this feeble crap that X" - where X was the name of 
the field researcher in question - "has sent us from half-way across 
the bloody Galaxy? What's the point of having somebody spending 
three whole orbital periods out in the bloody Gagrakacka Mind Zones, 
with all that stuff going on out there, if this load of anaemic squitter is 
the best he can be bothered to send us. Disallow his expenses!" 

"What shall we do with the copy?" the secretary would ask. 

"Ah, put it out over the network. Got to have something going out 
there. I've got a headache. I'm going home." 

So the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn through 
the legal department, and then be sent back down here where it 
would be broadcast out over the Sub-Etha-Net for instantaneous 
retrieval anywhere in the Galaxy. That was handled by equipment 
which was monitored and controlled by the terminals on the right- 
hand side of the room. 

Meanwhile the order to disallow the researcher's expenses was 
relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the right-hand 
corner, and it was to this terminal that Ford Prefect now swiftly made 
his way. 



(If you are reading this on planet Earth then: 

a) Good luck to you. There is an awful lot of stuff you don't know 
anything about, but you are not alone in this. It's just that in your case 
the consequences of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly 
terrible, but then, hey, that's just the way the cookie gets completely 
stomped on and obliterated. 

b) Don't imagine you know what a computer terminal is. 

A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a 
typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body 
can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.) 

Ford hurried over to the terminal, sat in front of it and quickly 
dipped himself into its universe. 

It wasn't the normal universe he knew. It was a universe of densely 
enfolded worlds, of wild topographies, towering mountain peaks, 
heart stopping ravines, of moons shattering off into sea horses, 
hurtful blurting crevices, silently heaving oceans and bottomless 
hurtling hooping funts. 

He held still to get his bearings. He controlled his breathing, closed 
his eyes and looked again. 

So this was where accountants spent their time. There was clearly 
more to them than met the eye. He looked around carefully, trying 
not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm him. 

He didn't know his way around this universe. He didn't even know 
the physical laws that determined its dimensional extents or 
behaviours, but his instinct told him to look for the most outstanding 
feature he could detect and make towards it. 

Way off in some indistinguishable distance - was it a mile or a 
million or a mote in his eye? - was a stunning peak that overarched 
the sky, climbed and climbed and spread out in flowering aigrettes3, 
agglomerates4, and arch imandrites5. 

He weltered towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last reached it 
in a meaninglessly long umthingth of time. 

He clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its roughly 
gnarled and pitted surface. Once he was certain that he was secure he 
made the hideous mistake of looking down. 

While he had been weltering, hooling and thurling, the distance 
beneath him had not bothered him unduly, but now that he was 



gripping, the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend. His 
fingers were white with pain and tension. His teeth were grinding and 
twisting against each other beyond his control. His eyes turned 
inwards with waves from the willowing extremities of nausea. 

With an immense effort of will and faith he simply let go and 
pushed. 

He felt himself float. Away. And then, counter-intuitively, upwards. 
And upwards. 

He threw his shoulders back, let his arms drop, gazed upwards and 
let himself be drawn loosely, higher and higher. 

Before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual 
universe, a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he could grip and 
on to which he could clamber. 

He rose, he gripped, he clambered. 

He panted a little. This was all a little stressful. 

He held tightly on to the ledge as he sat. He wasn't certain if this 
was to prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up from it, but 
he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which 
he found himself. 

The whirling, turning height span him and twisted his brain in upon 
itself till he found himself, eyes closed, whimpering and hugging the 
hideous wall of towering rock. 

He slowly brought his breathing back under control again. He told 
himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic representation of a 
world. A virtual universe. A simulated reality. He could snap back out 
of it at any moment. 

He snapped back out of it. 

He was sitting in a blue leatherette foam filled swivel-seated office 
chair in front of a computer terminal. 

He relaxed. 

He was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak perched on a 
narrow ledge above a drop of brain-swivelling dimensions. 

It wasn't just the landscape being so far beneath him - he wished it 
would stop undulating and waving. 



He had to get a grip. Not on the rock wall - that was an illusion. He 
had to get a grip on the situation, be able to look at the physical world 
he was in while drawing himself out of it emotionally. 

He clenched inwardly and then, just as he had let go of the rock 
face itself, he let go of the idea of the rock face and let himself just sit 
there clearly and freely. He looked out at the world. He was breathing 
well. He was cool. He was in charge again. 

He was in a four-dimensional topological model of the Guide's 
financial systems, and somebody or something would very shortly 
want to know why. 

And here they came. 

Swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of 
mean and steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads, pencil 
moustaches and querulous demands as to who he was, what he was 
doing there, what his authorisation was, what the authorisation of his 
authorising agent was, what his inside leg measurement was and so 
on. Laser light flickered all over him as if he was a packet of biscuits at 
a supermarket check-out. The heavier duty laser guns were held, for 
the moment, in reserve. The fact that all of this was happening in 
virtual space made no difference. Being virtually killed by a virtual 
laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you 
are as dead as you think you are. 

The laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered 
over his fingerprints, his retina and the follicle pattern where his hair 
line was receding. They didn't like what they were finding at all. The 
chattering and screeching of highly personal and insolent questions 
was rising in pitch. A little surgical steel scraper was reaching out 
towards the skin at the nape of his neck when Ford, holding his 
breath and praying very slightly, pulled Vann Harl's Ident-i-Eeze out of 
his pocket and waved it in front of them. 

Instantly every laser was diverted to the little card and Swept 
backwards and forwards over it and in it, examining and reading every 
molecule. 

Then, just as suddenly, they stopped. 

The entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention. 

"Nice to see you, Mr. Harl," they said in smarmy unison. "Is there 
anything we can do for you?" 



Ford smiled a slow and vicious smile. 


"Do you know," he said, "I rather think there is?" Five minutes later 
he was out of there. 

About thirty seconds to do the job, and three minutes thirty to 
cover his tracks. Fie could have done anything he liked in the virtual 
structure, more or less. Fie could have transferred ownership of the 
entire organisation into his own name, but he doubted if that would 
have gone unnoticed. Fie didn't want it anyway. It would have meant 
responsibility, working late nights at the office, not to mention 
massive and time-consuming fraud investigations and a fair amount 
of time in jail. Fie wanted something that nobody other than the 
computer would notice: that was the bit that took thirty seconds. 

The thing that took three minutes thirty was programming the 
computer not to notice that it had noticed anything. 

It had to want not to know about what Ford was up to, and then he 
could safely leave the computer to rationalise its own defences 
against the information ever emerging. It was a programming 
technique that had been reverse-engineered from the sort of 
psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had 
been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political 
office. 

The other minute was spent discovering that the computer system 
already had a mental block. A big one. 

Fie would never have discovered it if he hadn't been busy 
engineering a mental block himself. Fie came across a whole slew of 
smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary subroutines 
exactly where he had been planning to install his own. The computer 
denied all knowledge of them, of course, then blankly refused to 
accept that there was anything even to deny knowledge of, and was 
generally so convincing that even Ford almost found himself thinking 
he must have made a mistake. 

Fie was impressed. 

Fie was so impressed, in fact, that he didn't bother to install his 
own mental block procedures, he just set up calls to the ones that 
were already there, which then called themselves when questioned, 
and so on. 



He quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had 
installed himself, only to discover they weren't there. Cursing, he 
searched all over for them, but could find no trace of them at all. 

He was just about to start installing them all over again when he 
realised that the reason he couldn't find them was that they were 
working already. 

He grinned with satisfaction. 

He tried to discover what the computer's other mental block was 
all about, but it seemed, not unnaturally, to have a mental block 
about it. He could no longer find any trace of it at all, in fact; it was 
that good. He wondered if he had been imagining it. He wondered if 
he had been imagining that it was something to do with something in 
the building, and something to do with the number 13. He ran a few 
tests. Yes, he had obviously been imagining it. 

No time for fancy routes now, there was obviously a major security 
alert in progress. Ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to 
change to the express elevators. He had somehow to get the Ident-i- 
Eeze back into Harl's pocket before it was missed. How, he didn't 
know. 

The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of 
security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing filthy 
looking weapons. 

They ordered him out. 

With a shrug he stepped forward. They all pushed rudely past him 
into the elevator which took them down to continue their search for 
him on the lower levels. 

This was fun, thought Ford, giving Colin a friendly pat. Colin was 
about the first genuinely useful robot Ford had ever encountered. 
Colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful 
ecstasy. Ford was glad he'd named him after a dog. 

He was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the 
best, but he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually 
occurring if Harl did not discover that his Ident-i-Eeze was missing. He 
had somehow, surreptitiously, to return it. 

They went to the express elevators. 

"Hi," said the elevator they got into. 



"Hi," said Ford. 

"Where can I take you folks today?" said the elevator. 

"Floor 23," said Ford. 

"Seems to be a popular floor today," said the elevator. 

"Hmm," thought Ford, not liking the sound of that at all. The 
elevator lit up the twenty-third floor on its floor display and started to 
zoom upwards. Something about the floor display tweaked at Ford's 
mind but he couldn't catch what it was and forgot about it. He was 
more worried about the idea of the floor he was going to being a 
popular one. He hadn't really thought through how he was going to 
deal with whatever it was that was happening up there because he 
had no idea what he was going to find. He would just have to busk it. 

They were there. 

The doors slid open. 

Ominous quiet. 

Empty corridor. 

There was the door to Harl's office, with a slight layer of dust 
around it. Ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny 
molecular robots that had crawled out of the woodwork, built each 
other, rebuilt the door, disassembled each other and then crept back 
into the woodwork again and just waited for damage. Ford wondered 
what kind of life that was, but not for long because he was a lot more 
concerned about what his own life was like at that moment. 

He took a deep breath and started his run. 



Chapter 9 


Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole Galaxy of stuff out 
there for him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain 
to himself that it lacked just two things: the world he was born on and 
the woman he loved. 

Damn it and blast it, he thought, and felt the need of some 
guidance and advice. He consulted the Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy. He looked up "guidance" and it said "See under ADVICE". He 
looked up "advice" and it said "see under GUIDANCE". It had been 
doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently and he wondered if it was all 
it was cracked up to be. 

He headed to the outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy where, it was 
said, wisdom and truth were to be found, most particularly on the 
planet Hawalius, which was a planet of oracles and seers and 
soothsayers and also take-away pizza shops, because most mystics 
were completely incapable of cooking for themselves. 

However it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this 
planet. As Arthur wandered the streets of the village where the major 
prophets lived, it had something of a crestfallen air. He came across 
one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop in a despondent kind 
of way and asked him what was happening. 

"No call for us any more," he said gruffly as he started to bang a 
nail into the plank he was holding across the window of his hovel. 

"Oh? Why's that?" 

"Hold on to the other end of this and I'll show you." 

Arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old prophet 
scuttled into the recesses of his hovel, returning a moment or two 
later with a small Sub-Etha radio. He turned it on, fiddled with the dial 
for a moment and put the thing on the small wooden bench that he 
usually sat and prophesied on. He then took hold of the plank again 
and resumed hammering. 

Arthur sat and listened to the radio. 



"...be confirmed/' said the radio. 

"Tomorrow," it continued, "the Vice-President of Poffla Vigus, 

Roopy Ga Stip, will announce that he intends to run for President. In a 
speech he will give tomorrow at..." 

"Find another channel," said the prophet. Arthur pushed the preset 
button. 

"...refused to Comment," said the radio. "Next week's jobless totals 
in the Zabush sector, it continued, "will be the worst since records 
began. A report published next month says..." 

"Find another," barked the prophet, crossly. Arthur pushed the 
button again. 

"...denied it categorically," said the radio. "Next month's Royal 
Wedding between Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty and Princess 
Hooli of Raui Alpha will be the most spectacular ceremony the Bjanjy 
Territories has ever witnessed. Our reporter Trillian Astra is there and 
sends us this report." 

Arthur blinked. 

The sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands 
erupted from the radio. A very familiar voice said, "Well Krart, the 
scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incredible. 
Princess Hooli is looking radiant in a..." 

The prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the dusty 
ground, where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken. 

"See what we have to contend with?" grumbled the prophet. "Flere, 
hold this. Not that, this. No, not like that. This way up. Other way 
round, you fool." 

"I was listening to that," complained Arthur, grappling helplessly 
with the prophet's hammer. 

"So does everybody. That's why this place is like a ghost town." Fie 
spat into the dust. 

"No, I mean, that sounded like someone I knew." 

"Princess Hooli? If I had to stand around saying hello to everybody 
who's known Princess Hooli I'd need a new set of lungs." 

"Not the Princess," said Arthur. "The reporter. Fler name's Trillian. I 
don't know where she got the Astra from. She's from the same planet 
as me. I wondered where she'd got to." 



"Oh, she's all over the continuum these days. We can't get the tri-d 
TV stations out here of course, thank the Great Green Arkleseizure, 
but you hear her on the radio, gallivanting here and there through 
space/time. She wants to settle down and find herself a steady era 
that young lady does. It'll all end in tears. Probably already has." He 
swung with his hammer and hit his thumb rather hard. He started to 
speak in tongues. 

The village of oracles wasn't much better. 

He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to 
find the oracle that other oracles went to, but he was shut. There was 
a sign by the entrance saying, "I just don't know any more. Try next 
door (r), but that's just a suggestion, not formal oracular advice." 

"Next door" was a cave a few hundred yards away and Arthur 
walked towards it. Smoke and steam were rising from, respectively, a 
small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over it. There was 
also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At least Arthur thought it 
was coming from the pot. The distended bladders of some of the local 
goat-like things were hanging from a propped-up line drying in the 
sun, and the smell could have been coming from them. There was 
also, a worryingly small distance away, a pile of discarded bodies of 
the local goat-like things and the smell could have been coming from 
them. 

But the smell could just as easily have been coming from the old 
lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies. It was a 
hopeless task because each of the flies was about the size of a winged 
bottle top and all she had was a table tennis bat. Also she seemed half 
blind. Every now and then, by chance, her wild thrashing would 
connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying thunk, and the fly 
would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against the rock 
face a few yards from the entrance to her cave. 

She gave every impression, by her demeanour, that these were the 
moments she lived for. 

Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite 
distance, and then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her 
attention. The gentle cough, courteously meant, unfortunately 
involved first inhaling rather more of the local atmosphere than he 
had so far been doing and as a result, he erupted into a fit of raucous 



expectoration, and collapsed against the rock face, choking and 
streaming with tears. He struggled for breath, but each new breath 
made things worse. He vomited, half-choked again, rolled over his 
vomit, kept rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up on to his 
hands and knees and crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air. 

"Excuse me," he said. He got some breath back. "I really am most 
dreadfully sorry. I feel a complete idiot and..." He gestured helplessly 
towards the small pile of his own vomit lying spread around the 
entrance to her cave. 

"What can I say?" he said. "What can I possibly say?" 

This at least had gained her attention. She looked round at him 
suspiciously, but, being half blind, had difficulty finding him in the 
blurred and rocky landscape. 

He waved, helpfully. "Hello!" he called. 

At last she spotted him, grunted to herself and turned back to 
whacking flies. 

It was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air moved 
when she did, that the major source of the smell was in fact her. The 
drying bladders, the festering bodies and the noxious potage may all 
have been making violent contributions to the atmosphere, but the 
major olfactory presence was the woman herself. 

She got another good thwack at a fly. It smacked against the rock 
and dribbled its insides down it in what she clearly regarded, if she 
could see that far, as a satisfactory manner. 

Unsteadily, Arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a 
fistful of dried grass. He didn't know what else to do by way of 
announcing himself. He had half a mind just to wander off again, but 
felt awkward about leaving a pile of his vomit in front of the entrance 
to the woman's home. He wondered what to do about it. He started 
to pluck up more handsful of the scrubby dried grass that was to be 
found here and there. He was worried, though, that if he ventured 
nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear it up. 

Just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of 
action was he began to realise that she was at last saying something 
to him. 

"I beg your pardon?" he called out. 



"I said, can I help you?" she said, in a thin, scratchy voice, that he 
could only just hear. 

"Er, I came to ask your advice," he called back, feeling a bit 
ridiculous. 

She turned to peer at him, myopically, then turned back, swiped at 
a fly and missed. 

"What about?" she said. 

"I beg your pardon?" he said. 

"I said, what about?" she almost screeched. 

"Well," said Arthur. "Just sort of general advice, really. It said in the 
brochure -" 

"Ha! Brochure!" spat the old woman. She seemed to be waving her 
bat more or less at random now. 

Arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket. He wasn't 
quite certain why. He had already read it and she, he expected, 
wouldn't want to. He unfolded it anyway in order to have something 
to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or two. The copy in the 
brochure wittered on about the ancient mystical arts of the seers and 
sages of Hawalius, and wildly over-represented the level of 
accommodation available in Hawalion. Arthur still carried a copy of 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with him but found, when he 
consulted it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and 
paranoid and had lots of x's and j's and's in them. Something was 
wrong somewhere. Whether it was in his own personal unit, or 
whether it was something or someone going terribly amiss, or 
perhaps just hallucinating, at the heart of the Guide organisation itself, 
he didn't know. But one way or another he was even less inclined to 
trust it than usual, which meant that he trusted it not one bit, and 
mostly used it for eating his sandwiches off when he was sitting on a 
rock staring at something. 

The woman had turned and was walking slowly towards him now. 
Arthur tried, without making it too obvious, to judge the wind 
direction, and bobbed about a bit as she approached. 

"Advice," she said. "Advice, eh?" 

"Er, yes," said Arthur. "Yes, that is - " 

He frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that he hadn't 
misread it and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something. 



The brochure said "The friendly local inhabitants will be glad to share 
with you the knowledge and wisdom of the ancients. Peer with them 
into the swirling mysteries of past and future time!" There were some 
coupons as well, but Arthur had been far too embarrassed actually to 
cut them out or try to present them to anybody. 

"Advice, eh," said the old woman again. "Just sort of general advice, 
you say. On what? What to do with your life, that sort of thing?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. "That sort of thing. Bit of a problem I sometimes 
find if I'm being perfectly honest." He was trying desperately, with 
tiny darting movements, to stay upwind of her. She surprised him by 
suddenly turning sharply away from him and heading off towards her 
cave. 

"You'll have to help me with the photocopier, then," she said. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"The photocopier," she repeated, patiently. "You'll have to help me 
drag it out. It's solar-powered. I have to keep it in the cave, though, so 
the birds don't shit on it." 

"I see," said Arthur. 

"I'd take a few deep breaths if I were you," muttered the old 
woman, as she stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth. 

Arthur did as she advised. He almost hyperventilated in fact. When 
he felt he was ready, he held his breath and followed her in. 

The photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley. It stood 
just inside the dim shadows of the cave. The wheels were stuck 
obstinately in different directions and the ground was rough and 
stony. 

"Go ahead and take a breath outside," said the old woman. Arthur 
was going red in the face trying to help her move the thing. 

He nodded in relief. If she wasn't going to be embarrassed about it 
then neither, he was determined, would he. He stepped outside and 
took a few breaths, then came back in to do more heaving and 
pushing. He had to do this quite a few times till at last the machine 
was outside. 

The sun beat down on it. The old woman disappeared back into her 
cave again and brought with her some mottled metal panels, which 
she connected to the machine to collect the sun's energy. 



She squinted up into the sky. The sun was quite bright, but the day 
was hazy and vague. 

"It'll take a while," she said. 

Arthur said he was happy to wait. 

The old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire. Above it, 
the contents of the tin can were bubbling away. She poked about at 
them with a stick. 

"You won't be wanting any lunch?" she enquired of Arthur. 

"I've eaten, thanks," said Arthur. "No, really. I've eaten." 

"I'm sure you have," said the old lady. She stirred with the stick. 
After a few minutes she fished a lump of something out, blew on it to 
cool it a little, and then put it in her mouth. 

She chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit. 

Then she hobbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat-like things. 
She spat the lump out on to the pile. She hobbled slowly back to the 
can. She tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod-like thing that it 
was hanging from. 

"Can I help you?" said Arthur, jumping up politely. He hurried over. 

Together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried it 
awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave 
and towards a line of scrubby and gnarled trees, which marked the 
edge of a steep but quite shallow gully, from, which a whole new 
range of offensive smells was emanating. 

"Ready?" said the old Lady. 

"Yes..." said Arthur, though he didn't know for what. 

"One," said the old lady. 

"Two," she said. 

"Three," she added. 

Arthur realised just in time what she intended. Together they 
tossed the contents of the tin into the gully. 

After an hour or two of uncommunicative silence, the old woman 
decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run 
the photocopier now and she disappeared to rummage inside her 
cave. She emerged at last with a few sheaves of paper and fed them 
through the machine. 

She handed the copies to Arthur. 



"This is, er, this your advice then, is it?" said Arthur, leafing through 
them uncertainly. 

"No," said the old lady. "It's the story of my life. You see, the 
quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against 
the quality of life they actually lead. Now, as you look through this 
document you'll see that I've underlined all the major decisions I ever 
made to make them stand out. They're all indexed and cross- 
referenced. See? All I can suggest is that if you take decisions that are 
exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that I've taken, then maybe 
you won't finish up at the end of your life..." she paused, and filled 
her lungs for a good shout,"... in a smelly old cave like this!" 

She grabbed up her table tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve, stomped 
off to her pile of dead goat-like things, and started to set about the 
flies with vim and vigour. 

The last village Arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely high 
poles. They were so high that it wasn't possible to tell, from the 
ground, what was on top of them, and Arthur had to climb three 
before he found one that had anything on top of it at all other than a 
platform covered with bird droppings. 

Not an easy task. You went up the poles by climbing on the short 
wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending 
spirals. Anybody who was a less diligent tourist than Arthur would 
have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped right off to the nearest 
Bar & Grill, where you also could buy a range of particularly sweet 
and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the ascetics. But, largely 
as a result of this, most of the ascetics had gone now. In fact they had 
mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the 
more affluent worlds in the North West ripple of the Galaxy, where 
the living was easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the 
chocolate was just fabulous. Most of the ascetics, it turned out, had 
not known about chocolate before they took up asceticism. Most of 
the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all too 
well. 

At the top of the third pole Arthur stopped for a breather. He was 
very hot and out of breath, since each pole was about fifty or sixty 
feet high. The world seemed to swing vertiginously around him, but it 
didn't worry Arthur too much. He knew that, logically, he could not 



die until he had been to Stavromula Beta6, and had therefore 
managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme personal 
danger. He felt a little giddy perched fifty feet up in the air on top of a 
pole, but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich. He was just about to 
embark on reading the photocopied life history of the oracle, when he 
was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him. 

He turned so abruptly that he dropped his sandwich, which turned 
downwards through the air and was rather small by the time it was 
stopped by the ground. 

About thirty feet behind Arthur was another pole, and, alone 
amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen poles, the top of it 
was occupied. It was occupied by an old man who, in turn, seemed to 
be occupied by profound thoughts that were making him scowl. 

"Excuse me," said Arthur. The man ignored him. Perhaps he 
couldn't hear him. The breeze was moving about a bit. It was only by 
chance that Arthur had heard the slight cough. 

"Hello?" called Arthur. "Hello!" 

The man at last glanced round at him. He seemed surprised to see 
him. Arthur couldn't tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him or 
just surprsised. 

"Are you open?" called Arthur. 

The man frowned in incomprehension. Arthur couldn't tell if he 
couldn't understand or couldn't hear. 

"I'll pop over," called Arthur. "Don't go away." 

He clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the 
spiralling pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy. 

He started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man 
was sitting, and then suddenly realised that he had disoriented 
himself on the way down and didn't know for certain which one it was. 

He looked around for landmarks and worked out which was the 
right one. 

He climbed it. It wasn't. 

"Damn," he said. "Excuse me!" he called out to the old man again, 
who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away. "Got lost. 

Be with you in a minute." Down he went again, getting very hot and 
bothered. 



When he arrived, panting and sweating, at the top of the pole that 
he knew for certain was the right one he realised that the man was, 
somehow or other, mucking him about. 

"What do you want?" shouted the old man crossly at him. He was 
now sitting on top of the pole that Arthur recognised was the one 
that he had been on himself when eating his sandwich. 

"How did you get over there?" called Arthur in bewilderment. 

"You think I'm going to tell you just like that what it took me forty 
springs, summers and autumns of sitting on top of a pole to work 
out?" 

"What about winter?" 

"What about winter?" 

"Don't you sit on the pole in the winter?" 

"Just because I sit up a pole for most of my life," said the man, 
"doesn't mean I'm an idiot. I go south in the winter. Got a beach 
house. Sit on the chimney stack." 

"Do you have any advice for a traveller?" 

"Yes. Get a beach house." 

"I see." 

The man stared out over the hot, dry scrubby landscape. From here 
Arthur could just see the old woman, a tiny speck in the distance, 
dancing up and down swatting flies. 

"You see her?" called the old man, suddenly. 

"Yes," said Arthur. "I consulted her in fact." 

"Fat lot she knows. I got the beach house because she turned it 
down. What advice did she give you?" 

"Do exactly the opposite of everything she's done." 

"In other words, get a beach house." 

"I suppose so," said Arthur. "Well, maybe I'll get one." 

"Hmmm." 

The horizon was swimming in a fetid heat haze. 

"Any other advice?" asked Arthur. "Other than to do with real 
estate?" 

"A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind," said the 
man. He turned and looked at Arthur. 



Oddly, the man's face was now only a couple of feet away. He 
seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his body was 
sitting cross-legged on a pole forty feet away while his face was only 
two feet from Arthur's. Without moving his head, and without 
seeming to do anything odd at all, he stood up and stepped on to the 
top of another pole. Either it was just the heat, thought Arthur, or 
space was a different shape for him. 

"A beach house," he said, "doesn't even have to be on the beach. 
Though the best ones are. We all like to congregate," he went on, "at 
boundary conditions." 

"Really?" said Arthur. 

"Where land meets water. Where earth meets air. Where body 
meets mind. Where space meets time. We like to be on one side, and 
look at the other." 

Arthur got terribly excited. This was exactly the sort of thing he'd 
been promised in the brochure. Here was a man who seemed to be 
moving through some kind of Escher space saying really profound 
things about all sorts of stuff. 

It was unnerving though. The man was now stepping from pole to 
ground, from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from pole to horizon 
and back: he was making complete nonsense of Arthur's spatial 
universe. "Please stop!" Arthur said, suddenly. 

"Can't take it, huh?" said the man. Without the slightest movement 
he was now back, sitting cross-legged, on top of the pole forty feet in 
front of Arthur. "You come to me for advice, but you can't cope with 
anything you don't recognise. Hmmm. So we'll have to tell you 
something you already know but make it sound like news, eh? Well, 
business as usual I suppose." He sighed and squinted mournfully into 
the distance. 

"Where you from, boy?" he then asked. Arthur decided to be clever. 
He was fed up with being mistaken for a complete idiot by everyone 
he ever met. "Tell you what," he said. "You're a seer. Why don't you 
tell me?" 

The old man sighed again. "I was just," he said, passing his hand 
round behind his head, "making conversation." When he brought his 
hand round to the front again, he had a globe of the Earth spinning on 
his up-pointed forefinger. It was unmistakable. He put it away again. 
Arthur was stunned. 



"How did you - " 

"I can't tell you." 

"Why not? I've come all this way." "You cannot see what I see 
because you see what you see. You cannot know what I know 
because you know what you know. What I see and what I know 
cannot be added to what you see and what you know because they 
are not of the same kind. Neither can it replace what you see and 
what you know, because that would be to replace you yourself." 

"Hang on, can I write this down?" said Arthur, excitedly fumbling in 
his pocket for a pencil. 

"You can pick up a copy at the spaceport," said the old man. 
"They've got racks of the stuff." 

"Oh," said Arthur, disappointed. "Well, isn't there anything that's 
perhaps a bit more specific to me?" 

"Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is 
specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in 
the universe you perceive is specific to you." 

Arthur looked at him doubtfully. "Can I get that at the spaceport, 
too?" he said. 

"Check it out," said the old man. 

"It says in the brochure," said Arthur, pulling it out of his pocket 
and looking at it again, "that I can have a special prayer, individually 
tailored to me and my special needs." 

"Oh, all right," said the old man. "Here's a prayer for you. Got a 
pencil?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"It goes like this. Let's see now: "'Protect me from knowing what I 
don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are 
things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I 
decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know 
about. Amen.'" That's it. It's what you pray silently inside yourself 
anyway, so you may as well have it out in the open." 

"Hmmm," said Arthur. "Well, thank you - " 

"There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important," 
continued the old man, "so you'd better jot this down, too." 

"OK." 



"It goes, '"Lord, lord, lord..."' It's best to put that bit in, just in case. 
You can never be too sure "'Lord, lord, lord. Protect me from the 
consequences of the above prayer. Amen...'" And that's it. Most of 
the trouble people get into in life comes from missing out that last 
part." 

"Ever heard of a place called Stavromula Beta?" asked Arthur. 

"No." 

"Well, thank you for your help," said Arthur. 

"Don't mention it," said the man on the pole, and vanished. 



Chapter 10 


Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chiefs office, 
tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way 
once again, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart grey 
crushed leather sofa was and set up his strategic operational base 
behind it. 

That, at least, was the plan. 

Unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasn't there. 

Why, thought Ford, as he twisted himself round in mid-air, lurched, 
dived and scuttled for cover behind Harl's desk, did people have this 
stupid obsession with rearranging their office furniture every five 
minutes? 

Why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable if rather muted 
grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank? 

And who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher on his 
shoulder? Someone from head office? Couldn't be. This was head 
office. At least it was the head office of the Guide. Where these 
InfiniDim Enterprises guys came from Zarquon knew. Nowhere very 
sunny, judging from the slug-like colour and texture of their skins. This 
was all wrong, thought Ford. People connected with the Guide should 
come from sunny places. 

There were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed to be 
more heavily armed and armoured than you normally expected 
corporate executives to be, even in today's rough and tumble 
business world. 

Fie was making a lot of assumptions here, of course. Fie was 
assuming that the big, bull-necked, slug-like guys were in some way 
connected with InfiniDim Enterprises, but it was a reasonable 
assumption and he felt happy about it because they had logos on 
their armour-plating which said "InfiniDim Enterprises" on them. Fie 
had a nagging suspicion that this was not a business meeting, though. 



He also had a nagging feeling that these slug-like creatures were 
familiar to him in some way. Familiar, but in an unfamiliar guise. 

Well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds 
now, and thought that it was probably about time to start doing 
something constructive. He could take a hostage. That would be good. 

Vann Harl was in his swivel chair, looking alarmed, pale and shaken. 
Had probably had some bad news as well as a nasty bang to the back 
of his head. Ford leapt to his feet and made a running grab for him. 

Under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double 
underpinned elbow-lock. Ford managed surreptitiously to slip the 
Ident-i-Eeze back into Harl's inner pocket. 

Bingo! 

He'd done what he came to do. Now he just had to talk his way out 
of here. 

"OK," he said. "I..." He paused. 

The big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards Ford 
Prefect and pointing it at him, which Ford couldn't help feeling was 
wildly irresponsible behaviour. 

"I..." he started again, and then on a sudden impulse decided to 
duck. 

There was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the 
rocket launcher and a rocket leapt from its front. 

The rocket hurtled past Ford and hit the large plate-glass window, 
which billowed outwards in a shower of a million shards under the 
force of the explosion. Huge shock waves of noise and air pressure 
reverberated around the room, sweeping a couple of chairs, a filing 
cabinet and Colin the security robot out of the window. 

Ah! So they're not totally rocket-proof after all, thought Ford 
Prefect to himself. Someone should have a word with somebody 
about that. He disentangled himself from Harl and tried to work out 
which way to run. 

He was surrounded. 

The big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up into position 
for another shot. Ford was completely at a loss for what to do next. 

"Look," he said in a stern voice. But he wasn't certain how far 
saying things like "Look" in a stern voice was necessarily going to get 
him, and time was not on his side. What the hell, he thought, you're 



only young once, and threw himself out of the window. That would at 
least keep the element of surprise on his side. 



Chapter 11 


The first thing Arthur Dent had to do, he realised resignedly, was to 
get himself a life. This meant he had to find a planet he could have 
one on. It had to be a planet he could breathe on, where he could 
stand up and sit down without experiencing gravitational discomfort. 

It had to be somewhere where the acid levels were low and the plants 
didn't actually attack you. 

"I hate to be anthropic about this," he said to the strange thing 
behind the desk at the Resettlement Advice Centre on Pintleton Alpha, 
"but I'd quite like to live somewhere where the people look vaguely 
like me as well. You know. Sort of human." 

The strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger bits 
around and seemed rather taken aback by this. It oozed and glopped 
off its seat, thrashed its way slowly across the floor, ingested the old 
metal filing cabinet and then, with a great belch, excreted the 
appropriate drawer. It popped out a couple of glistening tentacles 
from its ear, removed some files from the drawer, sucked the drawer 
back in and vomited up the cabinet again. It thrashed its way back 
across the floor, slimed its way back up on to the seat and slapped the 
files on the table. 

"See anything you fancy?" it asked. 

Arthur looked nervously through some grubby and damp pieces of 
paper. He was definitely in some backwater part of the Galaxy here, 
and somewhere off to the left as far as the universe he knew and 
recognised was concerned. In the space where his own home should 
have been there was a rotten hick planet, drowned with rain and 
inhabited by thugs and boghogs. Even The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here, which was why he was 
reduced to making these sorts of enquiries in these sorts of places. 

One place he always asked after was Stavromula Beta, but no one had 
ever heard of such a planet. 



The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little to offer him 
because he had little to offer them. He had been extremely chastened 
to realise that although he originally came from a world which had 
cars and computers and ballet and armagnac he didn't, by himself, 
know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices 
he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich and 
that was it. There was not a lot of demand for his services. 

Arthur's heart sank. This surprised him, because he thought it was 
already about as low as it could possibly be. He closed his eyes for a 
moment. He so much wanted to be home. He so much wanted his 
own home world, the actual Earth he had grown up on, not to have 
been demolished. He so much wanted none of this to have happened. 
He so much wanted that when he opened his eyes again he would be 
standing on the doorstep of his little cottage in the west country of 
England, that the sun would be shining over the green hills, the post 
van would be going up the lane, the daffodils would be blooming in 
his garden, and in the distance the pub would be opening for lunch. 

He so much wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read 
it over a pint of bitter. He so much wanted to do the crossword. He so 
much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on 17 across. 

He opened his eyes. 

The strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping some kind 
of pseudopodia on the desk. 

Arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper. 

Grim, he thought. And the next. 

Very grim. And the next. 

Oh... Now that looked better. 

It was a world called Bartledan. It had oxygen. It had green hills. It 
even, it seemed, had a renowned literary culture. But the thing that 
most aroused his interest was a photograph of a small bunch of 
Bartledanian people, standing around in a village square, smiling 
pleasantly at the camera. 

"Ah," he said, and held the picture up to the strange thing behind 
the desk. 

Its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up and down the piece of 
paper, leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it. 

"Yes," it said with distaste. "They do look exactly like you." 



Arthur moved to Bartledan and, using some money he had made 
by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a DNA bank, he bought 
himself a room in the village featured in the picture. It was pleasant 
there. The air was balmy. The people looked like him and seemed not 
to mind him being there. They didn't attack him with anything. He 
bought some clothes and a cupboard to put them in. 

He had got himself a life. Now he had to find a purpose in it. 

At first he tried to sit and read. But the literature of Bartledan, 
famed though it was throughout this sector of the Galaxy for its 
subtlety and grace, didn't seem to be able to sustain his interest. The 
problem was that it wasn't actually about human beings after all. It 
wasn't about what human beings wanted. The people of Bartledan 
were remarkably like human beings to look at, but when you said 
"Good evening" to one, he would tend to look around with a slight 
sense of surprise, sniff the air and say that, yes, he supposed that it 
probably was a goodish evening now that Arthur came to mention it. 

"No, what I meant was to wish you a good evening," Arthur would 
say, or rather, used to say. He soon learned to avoid these 
conversations. "I mean that I hope you have a good evening," he 
would add. 

More puzzlement. 

"Wish?" the Bartledanian would say at last, in polite bafflement. 

"Er, yes," Arthur would then have said. "I'm just expressing the 
hope that..." 

"Hope?" 

"Yes." 

"What is hope?" 

Good question, thought Arthur to himself, and retreated back to 
his room to think about things. 

On the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he 
learnt about the Bartledanian view of the universe, which was that 
the universe was what the universe was, take it or leave it. On the 
other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire anything, not 
ever to. wish or to hope, was just not natural. 

Natural. There was a tricky word. 



He had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of 
as natural, like buying people presents at Christmas, stopping at red 
lights or falling at a rate of 32 feet/second/second, were just the 
habits of his own world and didn't necessarily work the same way 
anywhere else; but not to wish - that really couldn't be natural, could 
it? That would be like not breathing. 

Breathing was another thing that the Bartledanians didn't do, 
despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere. They just stood there. 
Occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff (without 
ever wishing to win though, of course - they would just play, and 
whoever won, won), but they never actually breathed. It was, for 
some reason, unnecessary. Arthur quickly learned that playing netball 
with them was just too spooky. Though they looked like humans, and 
even moved and sounded like humans, they didn't breathe and they 
didn't wish for things. 

Breathing and wishing for things, on the other hand, was just about 
all that Arthur seemed to do all day. Sometimes he would wish for 
things so much that his breathing would get quite agitated, and he 
would have to go and lie down for a bit. On his own. In his small room. 
So far from the world which had given birth to him that his brain 
could not even process the sort of numbers involved without just 
going limp. 

He preferred not to think about it. He preferred just to sit and read 
- or at least he would prefer it if there was anything worth reading. 

But nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted anything. Not even a 
glass of water. Certainly, they would fetch one if they were thirsty, 
but if there wasn't one available, they would think no more about it. 

He had just read an entire book in which the main character had, over 
the course of a week, done some work in his garden, played a great 
deal of netball, helped mend a road, fathered a child on his wife and 
then unexpectedly died of thirst just before the last chapter. In 
exasperation Arthur had combed his way back through the book and 
in the end had found a passing reference to some problem with the 
plumbing in Chapter 2. And that was it. So the guy dies. It just 
happens. 

It wasn't even the climax of the book, because there wasn't one. 

The character died about a third of the way through the penultimate 
chapter of the book, and the rest of it was just more stuff about road- 



mending. The book just finished dead at the one hundred thousandth 
word, because that was how long books were on Bartledan. 

Arthur threw the book across the room, sold the room and left. He 
started to travel with wild abandon, trading in more and more spit, 
toenails, fingernails, blood, hair, anything that anybody wanted, for 
tickets. For semen, he discovered, he could travel first class. He 
settled nowhere, but only existed in the hermetic, twilight world of 
the cabins of hyperspatial starships, eating, drinking, sleeping, 
watching movies, only stopping at spaceports to donate more DNA 
and catch the next long-haul ship out. He waited and waited for 
another accident to happen. 

The trouble with trying to make the right accident happen is that it 
won't. That is not what "accident" means. The accident that 
eventually occurred was not what he had planned at all. The ship he 
was on blipped in hyperspace, flickered horribly between ninety- 
seven different points in the Galaxy simultaneously, caught the 
unexpected gravitational pull of an uncharted planet in one of them, 
became ensnared in its outer atmosphere and began to fall, 
screaming and tearing, into it. 

The ship's systems protested all the way down that everything was 
perfectly normal and under control, but when it went into a final 
hectic spin, ripped wildly through half a mile of trees and finally 
exploded into a seething ball of flame it became clear that this was 
not the case. 

Fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly put itself 
out, as all unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do 
by law. For a short while afterwards, other small fires flared up here 
and there as odd pieces of scattered debris exploded quietly in their 
own time. Then they too died away. 

Arthur Dent, because of the sheer boredom of endless inter-stellar 
flight, was the only one on board who had actually familiarised 
himself with the ship's safety procedures in case of an unscheduled 
landing, and was therefore the sole survivor. He lay dazed, broken 
and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic cocoon with "Have a nice 
day" printed in over three thousand different languages all over it. 

Black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered 
mind. He knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he would survive, 
because he had not yet been to Stavromula Beta. 



After what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness, he became 
aware of quiet shapes moving around him. 



Chapter 12 


Ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters and 
chair parts. Again, he hadn't really thought things through, really, and 
was just playing it by ear, buying time. At times of major crisis he 
found it was often quite helpful to have his life flash before his eyes. It 
gave him a chance to reflect on things, see things in some sort of 
perspective, and it sometimes furnished him with a vital clue as to 
what to do next. 

There was the ground rushing up to meet him at 30 feet per 
second per second, but he would, he thought, deal with that problem 
when he got to it. First things first. 

Ah, here it came. His childhood. Flum drum stuff, he'd been 
through it all before. Images flashed by. Boring times on Betelgeuse 
Five. Zaphod Beeblebrox as a kid. Yes he knew all that. Fie wished he 
had some kind of fast forward in his brain. His seventh birthday party, 
being given his first towel. Come on, come on. 

Fie was twisting and turning downwards, the outside air at this 
height a cold shock to his lungs. Trying not to inhale glass. 

Early voyages to other planets. Oh for Zark's sake, this was like 
some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature. 
First beginning to work for the Guide. 

Ah! 

Those were the days. They worked out of a hut on the Bwenelli 
Atoll on Fanalla before the Riktanarqals and the Danqueds vertled it. 

Ha If a dozen guys, some towels, a handful of highly sophisticated 
digital devices, and most importantly a lot of dreams. No. Most 
importantly a lot of Fanallan rum. To be completely accurate, that 01" 
Janx Spirit was the absolute most important thing, then the Fanallan 
rum, and also some of the beaches on the Atoll where the local girls 
would hang out, but the dreams were important as well. Whatever 
happened to those? 



He couldn't quite remember what the dreams were in fact, but 
they had seemed immensely important at the time. They had 
certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was now 
falling down the side of. All of that had come when some of the 
original team had started to settle down and get greedy, while he and 
others had stayed out in the field, researching and hitch hiking, and 
gradually becoming more and more isolated from the corporate 
nightmare the Guide had inexorably turned into, and the architectural 
monstrosity it had come to occupy. Where were the dreams in that? 
He thought of all the corporate lawyers who occupied half of the 
building, all the "operatives" who occupied the lower levels, and all 
the sub-editors and their secretaries and their secretaries lawyers and 
their secretaries lawyers secretaries, and worst of all the accountants 
and the marketing department. 

He had half a mind just to keep on falling. Two fingers to the lot of 
them. 

He was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the 
marketing department hung out. Load of tosspots all arguing about 
what colour the Guide should be and exercising their infinitely 
infallible skills of being wise after the event. If any of them had 
chosen to look out of the window at that moment they would have 
been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping past them to his 
certain death and flicking V-signs at them. 

Sixteenth floor. Sub-editors. Bastards. What about all that copy of 
his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed from one planet 
alone and they'd cut it to two words. "Mostly Harmless." V-signs to 
them as well. 

Fifteenth floor. Logistical Administration, whatever that was about. 
They all had big cars. That, he thought, was what that was about. 

Fourteenth floor. Personnel. He had a very shrewd suspicion that it 
was they who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while the Guide 
metamorphosed into the corporate monolith (or rather, duolith - 
mustn't forget the lawyers) it had become. 

Thirteenth floor. Research and development. 

Hang about. 

Thirteenth floor. 



He was having to think rather fast at the moment because the 
situation was becoming a little urgent. 

He suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the elevator. It 
hadn't had a thirteenth floor. He'd thought no more about it because, 
having spent fifteen years on the rather backward planet Earth where 
they were superstitious about the number thirteen, he was used to 
being in buildings that numbered their floors without it. No reason for 
that here, though. 

The windows of the thirteenth floor, he could not help noticing as 
he flashed swiftly by them, were darkened. 

What was going on in there? He started to remember all the stuff 
that Harl had been talking about. One, new, multi-dimensional Guide 
spread across an infinite number of universes. It had sounded, the 
way Harl had put it, like wild meaninglessness dreamed up by the 
marketing department with the backing of the accountants. If it was 
any more real than that then it was a very weird and dangerous idea. 
Was it real? What was going on behind the darkened windows of the 
sealed-off thirteenth floor? 

Ford felt a rising sense of curiosity, and then a rising sense of panic. 
That was the complete list of rising feelings he had. In every other 
respect he was falling very rapidly. He really ought to turn his mind to 
wondering how he was going to get out of this situation alive. 

He glanced down. A hundred feet or so below him people were 
milling around, some of them beginning to look up expectantly. 
Clearing a space for him. Even temporarily calling off the wonderful 
and completely fatuous hunt for wockets. 

He would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below him, 
he hadn't realised before, was Colin. Colin had obviously been happily 
dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to 
do. 

"Colin!" Ford bawled. 

Colin didn't respond. Ford went cold. Then he suddenly realised 
that he hadn't told Colin his name was Colin. 

"Come up here!" Ford bawled. 

Colin bobbed up beside him. Colin was enjoying the ride down 
immensely and hoped that Ford was, too. 



Colin's world went unexpectedly dark as Ford's towel suddenly 
enveloped him. Colin immediately felt himself get much, much 
heavier. He was thrilled and delighted by the challenge that Ford had 
presented him with. Just not sure if he could handle it, that was all. 

The towel was slung over Colin. Ford was hanging from the towel, 
gripping to its seams. Other hitchhikers had seen fit to modify their 
towels in exotic ways, weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities 
and even computer equipment into their fabric. Ford was a purist. He 
liked to keep things simple. He carried a regular towel from a regular 
domestic soft furnishings shop. It even had a kind of blue and pink 
floral pattern despite his repeated attempts to bleach and stone wash 
it. It had a couple of pieces of wire threaded into it, a bit of flexible 
writing stick, and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners 
of the fabric so he could suck it in an emergency, but otherwise it was 
a simple towel you could dry your face on. 

The only actual modification he had been persuaded by a friend to 
make to it was to reinforce the seams. 

Ford gripped the seams like a maniac. 

They were still descending, but the rate had slowed. 

"Up, Colin!" he shouted. 

Nothing. 

"Your name," shouted Ford, "is Colin. So when I shout "'Up, Colin!"' 
I want you, Colin, to go up. OK? Up, Colin!" 

Nothing. Or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from Colin. 
Ford was very anxious. They were descending very slowly now, but 
Ford was very anxious about the sort of people he could see 
assembling on the ground beneath him. Friendly, local, wocket- 
hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy, bull-necked, slug-like 
creatures with rocket launchers were, it seemed, sliding out of what 
was usually called thin air. Thin air, as all experienced Galactic 
travellers well know, is, in fact, extremely thick with multi¬ 
dimensional complexities. 

"Up," bellowed Ford again. "Up! Colin, go up!" 

Colin was straining and groaning. They were now more or less 
stationary in the air. Ford felt as if his fingers were breaking. 

"Up!" 

They stayed put. 



"Up, up, up!" 

A slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him. Ford couldn't 
believe it. He was hanging from a towel in mid-air and a slug was 
preparing to fire rockets at him. He was running out of anything he 
could think of doing and was beginning to get seriously alarmed. 

This was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on having 
the Guide available for to give advice, however infuriating or glib, but 
this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket. And the Guide 
seemed to be no longer a friend and ally but was now itself a source 
of danger. These were the Guide offices he was hanging outside, for 
Zark's sake, in danger of his life from the people who now appeared 
to own the thing. What had become of all the dreams he vaguely 
remembered having on the Bwenelli Atoll? They should have let it all 
be. They should have stayed there. Stayed on the beach. Loved good 
women. Lived on fish. He should have known it was all wrong the 
moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea-monster 
pool in the atrium. He began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable. 
His fingers were on fire with clenched pain. And his ankle was still 
hurting. 

Oh thank you, ankle, he thought to himself bitterly. Thank you for 
bringing up your problems at this time. I expect you'd like a nice warm 
footbath to make you feel better, wouldn't you? Or at least you'd like 
me to... 

He had an idea. 

The armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to its 
shoulder. The rocket was presumably designed to hit anything in its 
path that moved. 

Ford tried not to sweat because he could feel his grip on the seams 
of his towel slipping. 

With the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at the heel of 
the shoe on his hurting foot. 

"Go up, damn you!" Ford muttered hopelessly to Colin, who was 
cheerily straining away but unable to rise. Ford worked away at the 
heel of his shoe. 

He was trying to judge the timing, but there was no point. Just go 
for it. He only had one shot and that was it. He had now eased the 



back of his shoe down off his heel. His twisted ankle felt a little better. 
Well that was good, wasn't it? 

With his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe. It slipped off 
his foot and fell through the air. About half a second later a rocket 
erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher, encountered the shoe 
falling through its path, went straight for it, hit it, and exploded with a 
great sense of satisfaction and achievement. 

This happened about fifteen feet from the ground. 

The main force of the explosion was directed downwards. Where, a 
second earlier, there had been a squad of InfiniDim Enterprises 
executives with a rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced 
plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone cut from the ancient 
alabastrum quarries of Zentalquabula there was now, instead, a bit of 
a pit with nasty bits in it. 

A great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing 
Ford and Colin violently up into the sky. Ford fought desperately and 
blindly to hold on and failed. He turned helplessly upwards through 
the sky, reached the peak of a parabola, paused and then started to 
fall again. He fell and fell and fell and suddenly winded himself badly 
on Colin, who was still rising. 

He clasped himself desperately on to the small spherical robot. 
Colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of the Guide 
offices, trying delightedly to control himself and slow down. 

The world span sickeningly round Ford's head as they span and 
twisted round each other and then, equally sickeningly, everything 
suddenly stopped. 

Ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window ledge. 

His towel fell past and he grabbed at it and caught it. 

Colin bobbed in the air inches away from him. 

Ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding and breath-less 
daze. The ledge was only about a foot wide and he was perched 
precariously on it, thirteen stories up. 

Thirteen. 

He knew they were thirteen stories up because the windows were 
dark. He was bitterly upset. He had bought those shoes for some 
absurd price in a store on the Lower East Side in New York. He had, as 
a result, written an entire essay on the joys of great footwear, all of 



which had been jettisoned in the "Mostly harmless" debacle. Damn 
everything. 

And now one of the shoes was gone. He threw his head back and 
stared at the sky. 

It wouldn't be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadn't 
been demolished, which meant that he wouldn't even be able to get 
another pair. 

Yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there was, 
of course, an almost infinite multiplicity of planets Earth, but, when 
you came down to it, a major pair of shoes wasn't something you 
could just replace by mucking about in multi-dimensional space/time. 

He sighed. 

Oh well, he'd better make the best of it. At least it had saved his 
life. For the time being. 

He was perched on a foot-wide ledge thirteen stories up the side of 
a building and he wasn't at all sure that that was worth a good shoe. 

He stared in woozily through the darkened glass. 

It was as dark and silent as the tomb. 

No. That was a ridiculous thing to think. He'd been to some great 
parties in tombs. 

Could he detect some movement? He wasn't quite sure. It seemed 
that he could see some kind of weird, flapping shadow. Perhaps it was 
just blood dribbling over his eyelashes. He wiped it away. Boy, he'd 
love to have a farm somewhere, keep some sheep. He peered into 
the window again, trying to make out what the shape was, but he had 
the feeling, so common in today's universe, that he was looking into 
some kind of optical illusion and that his eyes were just playing silly 
buggers with him. 

Was there a bird of some kind in there? Was that what they had 
hidden away up here on a concealed floor behind darkened, rocket- 
proof glass? Someone's aviary? There was certainly something 
flapping about in there, but it seemed like not so much a bird, more a 
kind of bird-shaped hole in space. 

He closed his eyes, which he'd been wanting to do for a bit anyway. 
He wondered what the hell to do next. Jump? Climb? He didn't think 
there was going to be any way of breaking in. OK, the supposedly 
rocket-proof glass hadn't stood up, when it came to it, to an actual 



rocket, but then that had been a rocket that had been fired at very 
short range from inside, which probably wasn't what the engineers 
who designed it had had in mind. It didn't mean he was going to be 
able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel and 
punching. What the hell, he tried it anyway and hurt his fist. It was 
just as well he couldn't get a good swing from where he was sitting or 
he might have hurt it quite badly. The building had been sturdily 
reinforced when it was completely rebuilt after the Frogstar attack, 
and was probably the most heavily armoured publishing company in 
the business, but there was always, he thought, some weakness in 
any system designed by a corporate committee. He had already found 
one of them. The engineers who designed the windows had not 
expected them to be hit by a rocket from short range from the inside, 
so the window had failed. 

So, what would the engineers not be expecting someone sitting on 
the ledge outside the window to do? 

He wracked his brains for a moment or so before he got it. 

The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be there in 
the first place. Only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was, 
so he was winning already. A common mistake that people make 
when trying to design something completely foolproof is to 
underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. 

He pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket, slid it into 
a crack where the window met its surrounding frame, and did 
something a rocket would not have been able to do. He wiggled it 
around a bit. He felt a catch slip. He slid the window open and almost 
fell backwards off the ledge laughing, giving thanks as he did so for 
the Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454. 

The Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454 had started 
off as just a lot of hot air. Hot air was, of course, the problem that 
ventilation was supposed to solve and generally it had solved the 
problem reasonably well up to the point when someone invented air- 
conditioning, which solved the problem far more throbbingly. 

And that was all well and good provided you could stand the noise 
and the dribbling until someone else came up with something even 
sexier and smarter than air-conditioning which was called in-building 
climate control. 



Now this was quite something. 

The major differences from just ordinary air-conditioning were that 
it was thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of 
sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment which was far 
better at knowing, moment by moment, what kind of air people 
wanted to breathe than mere people did. 

It also meant that, to be sure that mere people didn't muck up the 
sophisticated calculations which the system was making on their 
behalf, all the windows in the buildings were built sealed shut. This is 
true. 

While the systems were being installed, a number of people who 
were going to work in the buildings found themselves having 
conversations with Breathe-o-Smart systems fitters which went 
something like this: 

"But what if we want to have the windows open?" 

"You won't want to have the windows open with new Breathe-o- 
Smart." 

"Yes but supposing we just wanted to have them open for a little 
bit?" 

"You won't want to have them open even for a little bit. The new 
Breathe-o-Smart system will see to that." 

"Hmmm." 

"Enjoy Breathe-o-Smart!" 

"OK, so what if the Breathe-o-Smart breaks down or goes wrong or 
something?" 

"Ah! One of the smartest features of the Breathe-o-Smart is that it 
cannot possibly go wrong. So. No worries on that score. Enjoy your 
breathing now, and have a nice day." 

(It was, of course, as a result of the Great Ventilation and 
Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454, that all mechanical or electrical or 
quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam or piston- 
driven devices, are now requited to have a certain legend 
emblazoned on them somewhere. It doesn't matter how small the 
object is, the designers of the object have got to find a way of 
squeezing the legend in somewhere, because it is their attention 
which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that of the user's. 

The legend is this: 



"The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a 
thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot 
possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to 
get at or repair.') 

Major heat waves started to coincide, with almost magical 
precision, with major failures of the Breathe-o-Smart systems. To 
begin with this merely caused simmering resentment and only a few 
deaths from asphyxiation. 

The real horror erupted on the day that three events happened 
simultaneously. The first event was that Breathe-o-Smart Inc. issued a 
statement to the effect that best results were achieved by using their 
systems in temperate climates. 

The second event was the breakdown of a Breathe-o-Smart system 
on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of 
many hundreds of office staff into the street where they met the third 
event, which was a rampaging mob of long-distance telephone 
operators who had got so twisted with having to say, all day and 
every day, "Thank you for using BS&S" to every single idiot who 
picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the streets with trash 
cans, megaphones and rifles. 

In the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city, 
rocket-proof or not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries of 
"Get off the line, asshole! I don't care what number you want, what 
extension you're calling from. Go and stick a firework up your bottom! 
Yeeehaah! Hoo Hoo Hoo! Velooooom! Squawk!" and a variety of 
other animal noises that they didn't get a chance to practise in the 
normal line of their work. 

As a result of this, all telephone operators were granted a 
constitutional right to say "Use BS&S and die!" at least once an hour 
when answering the phone and all office buildings were required to 
have windows that opened, even if only a little bit. 

Another, unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide 
rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced, 
during the dark days of the Breathe-o-Smart tyranny, to jump in front 
of trains or stab themselves, could now just clamber out on to their 
own window ledges and leap off at their leisure. What frequently 
happened, though, was that in the moment or two they had to look 
around and gather their thoughts they would suddenly discover that 



all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective 
on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few 
sheep. 

Another completely unlooked for result was that Ford Prefect, 
stranded thirteen stories up a heavily armoured building armed with 
nothing but a towel and a credit card was nevertheless able to 
clamber through a supposedly rocket-proof window to safety. 

He closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed Colin 
to follow him through, and then started to look around for this bird 
thing. 

The thing he realised about the windows was this: because they 
had been converted into openable windows after they had first been 
designed to be impregnable, they were, in fact, much less secure than 
if they had been designed as openable windows in the first place. 

Hey ho, it's a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself, when 
he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to 
break into was not a very interesting one. 

He stopped in surprise. 

Where was the strange flapping shape? Where was anything that 
was worth all this palaver-the extraordinary veil of secrecy that 
seemed to lie over this room and the equally extraordinary sequence 
of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into it? 

The room, like every other room in this building now, was done out 
in some appallingly tasteful grey. There were a few charts and 
drawings on the wall. Most of them were meaningless to Ford, but 
then he came across something that was obviously a mock-up for a 
poster of some kind. 

There was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said 
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk II: the single most 
astounding thing of any kind ever. Coming soon to a dimension near 
you." No more information than that. 

Ford looked around again. Then his attention was gradually drawn 
to Colin, the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was cowering in 
a corner of the room gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear. 



Odd, thought Ford. He looked around to see what it was that Colin 
might have been reacting to. Then he saw something that he hadn't 
noticed before, lying quietly on top of a workbench. 

It was circular and black and about the size of a small side plate. Its 
top and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it resembled a small 
lightweight throwing discus. 

Its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth, unbroken and 
featureless. 

It was doing nothing. Then Ford noticed that there was something 
written on it. Strange. There hadn't been anything written on it a 
moment ago and now suddenly there was. There just didn't seem to 
have been any observable transition between the two states. 

All it said, in small, alarming letters was a single word: 

PANIC 

A moment ago there hadn't been any marks or cracks in its surface. 
Now there were. They were growing. 

Panic, the Guide Mk II said. Ford begin to do as he was told. He had 
just remembered why the slug-like creatures looked familiar. Their 
colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey, but in all other respects 
they looked exactly like Vogons. 



Chapter 13 


The ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide clearing, 
a hundred yards or so from the village. 

It arrived suddenly and unexpectedly but with a minimum of fuss. 
One moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early 
autumn - the leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold, the 
river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the mountains 
in the north, the plumage of the pikka birds was beginning to thicken 
in anticipation of the coming winter frosts, any day now the Perfectly 
Normal Beasts would start their thunderous migration across the 
plains, and Old Thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to himself as he 
hobbled his way around the village, a muttering which meant that he 
was rehearsing and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the 
past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice 
but to gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say 
that that wasn't how they remembered it - and the next moment 
there was a spaceship sitting there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun. 

It hummed for a bit and then stopped. 

It wasn't a big spaceship. If the villagers had been experts on 
spaceships they would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty 
one, a small sleek Hrundi four-berth runabout with just about every 
optional extra in the brochure except Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis, 
which only wimps went for. You can't get a good tight, sharp curve 
round a tri-lateral time axis with Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis. All right, 
it's a bit safer, but it makes the handling go all soggy. 

The villagers didn't know all that, of course. Most of them here on 
the remote planet of Lamuella had never seen a spaceship, certainly 
not one that was all in one piece, and as it shone warmly in the 
evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they had come 
across since the day Kirp caught a fish with a head at both ends. 

Everybody had fallen silent. 



Whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been 
wandering about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying water, teasing 
the pikka birds, or just amiably trying to stay out of Old Thrashbarg's 
way, suddenly all activity died away and everybody turned to look at 
the strange object in amazement. 

Or, not quite everybody. The pikka birds tended to be amazed by 
completely different things. A perfectly ordinary leaf lying 
unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in paroxysms 
of confusion; sunrise took them completely by surprise every morning, 
but the arrival of an alien craft from another world simply failed to 
engage any part of their attention. They continued to kar and rit and 
huk as they pecked for seeds on the ground; the river continued with 
its quiet, spacious burbling. 

Also, the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the 
left continued unabated. 

Suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself 
outwards and downwards from the spaceship. Then, for a minute or 
two, nothing further seemed to happen, other than the loud singing 
from the last hut on the left, and the thing just sat there. 

Some of the villagers, particularly the boys, began to edge forward 
a little bit to have a closer look. Old Thrashbarg tried to shoo them 
back. This was exactly the sort of thing that Old Thrashbarg didn't like 
to have happening. He hadn't foretold it, not even slightly, and even 
though he would be able to wrestle the whole thing into his 
continuing story somehow or other, it really was all getting a bit much 
to deal with. 

He strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms and 
his ancient knobbly staff into the air. The long warm light of the 
evening sun caught him nicely. He prepared to welcome whatever 
gods these were as if he had been expecting them all along. 

Still nothing happened. 

Gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument 
going on inside the craft. Time went by and Old Thrashbarg's arms 
were beginning to ache. 

Suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again. That made it easy 
for Thrashbarg. They were demons and he had repulsed them. The 
reason he hadn't foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbade. 



Almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other 
side of the craft from where Thrashbarg was standing, and two figures 
at last emerged on it, still arguing with each other and ignoring 
everybody, even Thrashbarg, whom they wouldn't even have noticed 
from where they were standing. 

Old Thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard. 

To continue to stand there with his arms upraised? To kneel with 
his head bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at them? To 
fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner struggle? Perhaps 
just to go off to the woods and live in a tree for a year without 
speaking to anyone? 

He opted just to drop his arms smartly as if he had done what he 
meant to do. They were really hurting so he didn't have much choice. 
He made a small, secret sign he had just invented towards the ramp 
which had closed and then made three and a half steps backwards, so 
he could at least get a good look at whoever these people were and 
then decide what to do next. 

The taller one was a very good looking woman wearing soft and 
crumply clothes. Old Thrashbarg didn't know this, but they were 
made of RymplonTM, a new synthetic fabric which was terrific for 
space travel because it looked its absolute best when it was all 
creased and sweaty. 

The shorter one was a girl. She was awkward and sullen looking, 
and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute worst when 
they were all creased and sweaty, and what was more she almost 
certainly knew it. 

All eyes watched them, except for the pikka birds, which had their 
own things to watch. 

The woman stood and looked around her. She had a purposeful air 
about her. There was obviously something in particular she wanted, 
but she didn't know exactly where to find it. She glanced from face to 
face among the villagers assembled curiously around her without 
apparently seeing what she was looking for. 

Thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all, and decided to 
resort to chanting. He threw back his head and began to wail, but was 
instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song from the hut of the 
Sandwich Maker: the last one on the left. The woman looked round 



sharply, and gradually a smile came over her face. Without so much 
as a glance at Old Thrashbarg she started to walk towards the hut. 

There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is 
given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple 
task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound: 
choosing the right bread for instance. The Sandwich Maker had spent 
many months in daily consultation and experiment with Grarp the 
baker and eventually they had between them created a loaf of exactly 
the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, 
while still being light, moist and having that fine nutty flavour which 
best enhanced the savour of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh. 

There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the precise 
relationships between the width and height of the slice and also its 
thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to 
the finished sandwich: here again, lightness was a virtue, but so too 
were firmness, generosity and that promise of succulence and savour 
that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience. 

The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days 
that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the Baker at his 
oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker, weighing and 
balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness, 
strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all 
enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and 
many was the evening when the Sandwich Maker and the Tool Maker 
could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the 
Tool Maker's forge making slow sweeping movements through the air 
trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with 
the balance of another, the suppleness of a third and the handle 
binding of a fourth. 

Three knives altogether were required. First there was the knife for 
the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade which imposed a 
clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading 
knife, which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone 
to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the 
combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to 
achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread. 



The chief amongst the knives, of course, was the carving knife. This 
was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium 
through which it moved, as did the bread knife; it must work with it, 
be Guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most 
exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy 
folds from the main hunk of meat. The Sandwich Maker would then 
flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist on to the beautifully 
proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then 
at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to 
gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just 
four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the 
trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the 
primary slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings 
were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly and 
without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted 
perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, 
and the main act of creation would be accomplished. 

The Sandwich Maker would pass what he had made to his assistant 
who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a 
touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the topmost layer of bread 
and cut the sandwich with a fourth and altogether plainer knife. It 
was not that these were not also skillful operations, but they were 
lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice who would 
one day, when the Sandwich Maker finally laid down his tools, take 
over from him. It was an exalted position and that apprentice, 
Drimple, was the envy of his fellows. There were those in the village 
who were happy chopping wood, those who were content carrying 
water, but to be the Sandwich Maker was very heaven. 

And so the Sandwich Maker sang as he worked. 

He was using the last of the year's salted meat. It was a little past 
its best now, but still the rich savour of Perfectly Normal Beast meat 
was something unsurpassed in any of the Sandwich Maker's previous 
experience. Next week it was anticipated that the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts would appear again for their regular migration, whereupon the 
whole village would once again be plunged into frenetic action: 
hunting the Beasts, killing perhaps six, maybe even seven dozen of 
the thousands that thundered past. Then the Beasts must be rapidly 
butchered and cleaned, with most of the meat salted to keep it 



through the winter months until the return migration in the spring, 
which would replenish their supplies. 

The very best of the meat would be roasted straight away for the 
feast that marked the Autumn Passage. The celebrations would last 
for three days of sheer exuberance, dancing and stories that Old 
Thrashbarg would tell of how the hunt had gone, stories that he 
would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while the rest of 
the village was out doing the actual hunting. 

And then the very, very best of the meat would be saved from the 
feast and delivered cold to the Sandwich Maker. And the Sandwich 
Maker would exercise on it the skills that he had brought to them 
from the gods, and make the exquisite Sandwiches of the Third 
Season, of which the whole village would partake before beginning, 
the next day, to prepare themselves for the rigours of the coming 
winter. 

Today he was just making ordinary sandwiches, if such delicacies, 
so lovingly crafted, could ever be called ordinary. Today his assistant 
was away so the Sandwich Maker was applying his own garnish, 
which he was happy to do. He was happy with just about everything 
in fact. 

He sliced, he sang. He flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice 
of bread, trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw. 
A little salad, a little sauce, another slice of bread, another sandwich, 
another verse of Yellow Submarine. 

"Hello, Arthur." 

The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off. 

The villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had 
marched boldly to the hut of the Sandwich Maker. The Sandwich 
Maker had been sent to them by Almighty Bob in a burning fiery 
chariot. This, at least, was what Thrashbarg said, and Thrashbarg was 
the authority on these things. So, at least, Thrashbarg claimed, and 
Thrashbarg was... and so on and so on. It was hardly worth arguing 
about. 

A few villagers wondered why Almighty Bob would send his onlie 
begotten Sandwich Maker in a burning fiery chariot rather than 
perhaps in one that might have landed quietly without destroying half 



the forest, filling it with ghosts and also injuring the Sandwich Maker 
quite badly. Old Thrashbarg said that it was the ineffable will of Bob, 
and when they asked him what ineffable meant he said look it up. 

This was a problem because Old Thrashbarg had the only dictionary 
and he wouldn't let them borrow it. They asked him why not and he 
said that it was not for them to know the will of Almighty Bob, and 
when they asked him why not again he said because he said so. 
Anyway, somebody sneaked into Old Thrashbarg's hut one day while 
he was out having a swim and looked up "ineffable". "Ineffable" 
apparently meant "unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be 
known or spoken about". So that cleared that up. 

At least they had got the sandwiches. 

One day Old Thrashbarg said that Almighty Bob had decreed that 
he, Thrashbarg, was to have first pick of the sandwiches. The villagers 
asked him when this had happened, exactly, and Thrashbarg said it 
had happened yesterday, when they weren't looking. "Have faith," 

Old Thrashbarg said, "or burn!" They let him have first pick of the 
sandwiches. It seemed easiest. 

And now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere, and gone 
straight for the Sandwich Maker's hut. His fame had obviously spread, 
though it was hard to know where to since, according to Old 
Thrashbarg, there wasn't anywhere else. Anyway, wherever it was she 
had come from, presumably somewhere ineffable, she was here now 
and was in the Sandwich Maker's hut. Who was she? And who was 
the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut moodily and 
kicking at stones and showing every sign of not wanting to be there? 

It seemed odd that someone should come all the way from 
somewhere ineffable in a chariot that was obviously a vast 
improvement on the burning fiery one which had brought them the 
Sandwich Maker, if she didn't even want to be here? 

They all looked to Thrashbarg, but he was on his knees mumbling 
and looking very firmly up into the sky and not catching anybody 
else's eye until he'd thought of something. 

"Trillian!" said the Sandwich Maker, sucking his bleeding thumb. 
"What...? Who...? When...? Where...?" 



"Exactly the questions I was going to ask you," said Trillian, looking 
around Arthur's hut. It was neatly laid out with his kitchen utensils. 
There were some fairly basic cupboards and shelves, and a basic bed 
in the corner. A door at the back of the room led to something Trillian 
couldn't see because the door was closed. "Nice," she said, but in an 
enquiring tone of voice. She couldn't quite make out what the set-up 
was. 

"Very nice," said Arthur. "Wonderfully nice. I don't know when I've 
ever been anywhere nicer. I'm happy here. They like me, I make 
sandwiches for them, and... er, well that's it really. They like me and I 
make sandwiches for them." 

"Sounds, er..." 

"Idyllic," said Arthur, firmly. "It is. It really is. I don't expect you'd 
like it very much, but for me it's, well, it's perfect. Look, sit down, 
please, make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything, er, a 
sandwich?" 

Trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it. She sniffed it 
carefully. 

"Try it," said Arthur, "it's good." 

Trillian took a nibble, then a bite and munched on it thoughtfully. 

"It is good," she said, looking at it. 

"My life's work," said Arthur, trying to sound proud and hoping he 
didn't sound like a complete idiot. He was used to being revered a bit, 
and was having to go through some unexpected mental gear changes. 

"What's the meat in it?" asked Trillian. 

"Ah yes, that's, um, that's Perfectly Normal Beast." 

"It's what?" 

"Perfectly Normal Beast. It's a bit like a cow, or rather a bull. Kind 
of like a buffalo in fact. Large, charging sort of animal." 

"So what's odd about it?" 

"Nothing, it's Perfectly Normal." 

"I see." 

"It's just a bit odd where it comes from." 

Tricia frowned, and stopped chewing. 

"Where does it come from?" she asked with her mouth full. She 
wasn't going to swallow until she knew. 



"Well it's not just a matter of where it comes from, it's also where 
it goes to. It's all right, it's perfectly safe to swallow. I've eaten tons of 
it. It's great. Very succulent. Very tender. Slightly sweet flavour with a 
long dark finish." 

Trillian still hadn't swallowed. 

"Where," she said, "does it come from, and where does it go to?" 

"They come from a point just slightly to the east of the Hondo 
Mountains. They're the big ones behind us here, you must have seen 
them as you came in, and then they sweep in their thousands across 
the great Anhondo plains and, er, well that's it really. That's where 
they come from. That's where they go." 

Trillian frowned. There was something she wasn't quite getting 
about this. 

"I probably haven't made it quite clear," said Arthur. "When I say 
they come from a point to the east of the Hondo Mountains, I mean 
that that's where they suddenly appear. Then they sweep across the 
Anhondo plains and, well, vanish really. We have about six days to 
catch as many of them as we can before they disappear. In the spring 
they do it again only the other way round, you see." 

Reluctantly, Trillian swallowed. It was either that or spit it out, and 
it did in fact taste pretty good. 

"I see," she said, once she had reassured herself that she didn't 
seem to be suffering any ill effects. "And why are they called Perfectly 
Normal Beasts?" 

"Well, I think because otherwise people might think it was a bit odd. 
I think Old Thrashbarg called them that. He says that they come from 
where they come from and they go to where they go to and that it's 
Bob's will and that's all there is to it." 

"Who..." 

"Just don't even ask." 

"Well, you look well on it." 

"I feel well. You look well." 

"I'm well. I'm very well." 

"Well, that's good." 

"Yes." 

"Good." 



"Good." 

"Nice of you to drop in." 

"Thanks." 

"Well," said Arthur, casting around himself. Astounding how hard it 
was to think of anything to say to someone after all this time. 

"I expect you're wondering how I found you," said Trillian. 

"Yes!" said Arthur. "I was wondering exactly that. How did you find 
me?" 

"Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one of the big 
Sub-Etha broadcasting networks that - " 

"I did know that," said Arthur, suddenly remembering. "Yes, you've 
done very well. That's terrific. Very exciting. Well done. Must be a lot 
of fun." 

"Exhausting." 

"All that rushing around. I expect it must be, yes." 

"We have access to virtually every kind of information. I found your 
name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed." 

Arthur was astonished. 

"You mean they knew about the crash?" 

"Well, of course they knew. You don't have a whole spaceliner 
disappear without someone knowing about it." 

"But you mean, they knew where it had happened? They knew I'd 
survived?" 

"Yes." 

"But nobody's ever been to look or search or rescue. There's been 
absolutely nothing." 

"Well there wouldn't be. It's a whole complicated insurance thing. 
They just bury the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. The 
insurance business is completely screwy now. You know they've 
reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors?" 

"Really?" said Arthur. "No I didn't. For what offence?" 

Trillian frowned. 

"What do you mean, offence?" 

"I see." 



Trillian gave Arthur a long look, and then, in a new tone of voice, 
said, "It's time for you to take responsibility, Arthur." 

Arthur tried to understand this remark. He found it often took a 
moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that people were 
driving at, so he let a moment or two pass at a leisurely rate. Life was 
so pleasant and relaxed these days, there was time to let things sink 
in. He let it sink in. 

He still didn't quite understand what she meant, though, so in the 
end he had to say so. 

Trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to the door of 
the hut. 

"Random?" she called. "Come in. Come and meet your father." 



Chapter 14 


As the Guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disk. Ford 
realised some pretty hectic stuff. Or at least he tried to realise it, but 
it was too hectic to take in all in one go. His head was hammering, his 
ankle was hurting, and though he didn't like to be a wimp about his 
ankle, he always found that intense multi-dimensional logic was 
something he understood best in the bath. He needed time to think 
about this. Time, a tall drink, and some kind of rich, foamy oil. 

He had to get out of here. He had to get the Guide out of here. He 
didn't think they'd make it together. 

He glanced wildly round the room. 

Think, think, think. It had to be something simple and obvious. If he 
was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing with nasty, 
lurking Vogons, then the more simple and obvious the better. 

Suddenly he saw what he needed. 

He wouldn't try to beat the system, he would just use it. The 
frightening thing about the Vogons was their absolute mindless 
determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were 
determined to do. There was never any point in trying to appeal to 
their reason because they didn't have any. However, if you kept your 
nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered, bludgeoning 
insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered. It wasn't merely that 
their left hand didn't always know what their right hand was doing, so 
to speak; quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well. 

Did he dare just post the thing to himself? 

Did he dare just put it in the system and let the Vogons work out 
how to get the thing to him while at the same time they were busy, as 
they probably would be, tearing the building apart to find out where 
he'd hidden it? 


Yes. 



Feverishly, he packed it. He wrapped it. He labelled it. With a 
moment's pause to wonder if he was really doing the right thing, he 
committed the package to the building's internal mail chute. 

"Colin," he said, turning to the little, hovering ball. "I am going to 
abandon you to your fate." 

"I'm so happy," said Colin. 

"Make the most of it," said Ford. "Because what I want you to do is 
to nursemaid that package out of the building. They'll probably 
incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here to help. It will 
be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too bad. Got it?" 

"I gurgle with pleasure," said Colin. 

"Go!" said Ford. 

Colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge. 
Now Ford had only himself to worry about, but that was still quite a 
substantial worry. There were noises of heavy running footsteps 
outside the door, which he had taken the precaution of locking and 
shifting a large filing cabinet in front of. 

He was worried that everything had gone so smoothly. Everything 
had fitted terribly well. He had hurtled through the day with reckless 
abandon and yet everything had worked out with uncanny neatness. 
Except for his shoe. He was bitter about his shoe. That was an account 
that was going to have to be settled. 

With a deafening roar the door exploded inwards. In the turmoil of 
smoke and dust he could see large, slug-like creatures hurrying 
through. 

So everything was going well was it? Everything was working out as 
if the most extraordinary luck was on his side? Well, he'd see about 
that. 

In a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of the window 
again. 



Chapter 15 


The first month, getting to know each other, was a little difficult. 

The second month, trying to come to terms with what they'd got to 
know about each other in the first month, was much easier. 

The third month, when the box arrived, was very tricky indeed. 

At the beginning, it was a problem even trying to explain what a 
month was. This had been a pleasantly simple matter for Arthur, here 
on Lamuella. The days were just a little over twenty-five hours long, 
which basically meant an extra hour in bed every single day and, of 
course, having regularly to reset his watch, which Arthur rather 
enjoyed doing. 

He also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which 
Lamuella had - one of each - as opposed to some of the planets he'd 
fetched up on from time to time which had had ridiculous numbers of 
them. 

The planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days, which 
was a good number because it meant the year didn't drag by. The 
moon orbited Lamuella just over nine times a year, which meant that 
a month was a little over thirty days, which was absolutely perfect 
because it gave you a little more time to get things done in. It was not 
merely reassuringly like Earth, it was actually rather an improvement. 

Random, on the other hand, thought she was trapped in a 
recurring nightmare. She would have crying fits and think the moon 
was out to get her. Every night it was there, and then, when it went, 
the sun came out and followed her. Over and over again. 

Trillian had warned Arthur that Random might have some difficulty 
in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up 
till now, but Arthur hadn't been ready for actual howling at the moon. 

He hadn't been ready for any of this of course. 

His daughter? 



His daughter? He and Trillian had never even - had they? He was 
absolutely convinced he would have remembered. What about 
Zaphod? 

"Not the same species, Arthur," Trillian had answered. "When I 
decided I wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on me and 
could find only one match anywhere. It was only later that it dawned 
on me. I double checked and I was right. They don't usually like to tell 
you, but I insisted." 

"You mean you went to a DNA bank?" Arthur had asked, pop-eyed. 

"Yes. But she wasn't quite as random as her name suggests, 
because, of course, you were the only homo sapiens donor. I must say, 
though, it seems you were quite a frequent flyer." 

Arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy looking girl who was 
slouching awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him. 

"But when... how long...?" 

"You mean, what age is she?" 

"Yes." 

"The wrong one." 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean that I haven't any idea." 

"What?" 

"Well, in my time line I think it's about ten years since I had her, 
but she's obviously quite a lot older than that. I spend my life going 
backwards and forwards in time, you see. The job. I used to take her 
with me when I could, but it just wasn't always possible. Then I used 
to put her into day care time zones, but you just can't get reliable 
time tracking now. You leave them there in the morning, you've 
simply no idea how old they'll be in the evening. You complain till 
you're blue in the face but it doesn't get you anywhere. I left her at 
one of the places for a few hours once, and when I came back she'd 
passed puberty. I've done all I can, Arthur, it's over to you. I've got a 
war to cover." 

The ten seconds that passed after Trillian left were about the 
longest of Arthur Dent's life. Time, we know, is relative. You can travel 
light years through the stars and back, and if you do it at the speed of 
light then, when you return, you may have aged mere seconds while 



your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty, thirty, forty or 
however many years it is, depending on how far you travelled. 

This will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly if 
you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister. The seconds that 
you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to 
prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family 
relationships when you return. 

Ten seconds silence was not enough time for Arthur to reassemble 
his whole view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included 
an entire new daughter of whose merest existence he had had not 
the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he had woken that morning. 
Deep, emotional family ties cannot be constructed in ten seconds, 
however far and fast you travel away from them, and Arthur could 
only feel helpless, bewildered and numb as he looked at the girl 
standing in his doorway, staring at his floor. 

He supposed that there was no point in pretending not to be 
hopeless. 

He walked over and he hugged her. 

"I don't love you," he said. "I'm sorry. I don't even know you yet. 

But give me a few minutes." 

We live in strange times. 

We also live in strange places: each in a universe of our own. The 
people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of 
whole other universes intersecting with our own. Being able to glance 
out into this bewildering complexity of infinite recursion and say 
things like, "Oh, hi Ed! Nice tan. How's Carol?" involves a great deal of 
filtering skill for which all conscious entities have eventually to 
develop a capacity in order to protect themselves from the 
contemplation of the chaos through which they seethe and tumble. 

So give your kid a break, OK? 

Extract from Practical Parenting in a 

Fractally Demented Universe. 

"What's this?" 

Arthur had almost given up. That is to say, he was not going to give 
up. He was absolutely not going to give up. Not now. Not ever. But if 



he had been the sort of person who was going to give up, this was 
probably the time he would have done it. 

Not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go and 
play in the paleozoic era, not seeing why they had to have the gravity 
on the whole time and shouting at the sun to stop following her. 
Random had also used his carving knife to dig up stones to throw at 
the pikka birds for looking at her like that. 

Arthur didn't even know if Lamuella had had a paleozoic era. 
According to Old Thrashbarg the planet had been found fully-formed 
in the navel of a giant earwig at four-thirty one Vroonday afternoon, 
and although Arthur, as a seasoned galactic traveller with good "O" 
level passes in Physics and Geography, had fairly serious doubts about 
this, it was rather a waste of time trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg 
and there had never been much point before. 

He sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife. He was 
going to love her if it killed him, or her, or both. It wasn't easy being a 
father. He knew that no one had ever said it was going to be easy, but 
that wasn't the point because he'd never asked about being one in 
the first place. 

He was doing his best. Every moment that he could wrest away 
from making sandwiches he was spending with her, talking to her, 
walking with her, sitting on the hill with her watching the sun go 
down over he valley in which the village nestled, trying to find out 
about her life, trying to explain to her about his. It was a tricky 
business. The common ground between them, apart from the fact 
that they had almost identical genes, was about the size of a pebble. 
Or rather, it was about the size of Trillian and of her they had slightly 
differing views. 

"What's this?" 

He suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he hadn't 
noticed. Or rather he had not recognized her voice. 

Instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him, which 
was bitter and truculent, she was just asking him a simple question. 

He looked round in surprise. 

She was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hut in that 
rather hunched way she had, knees together, feet splayed out, with 



her dark hair hanging down over her face as she looked at something 
she had cradled in her hands. 

Arthur went over to her, a little nervously. 

Her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far they'd all 
been between different types of bad ones. Outbreaks of bitter 
recrimination would give way without warning to abject self-pity and 
then long bouts of sullen despair which were punctuated with sudden 
acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects and demands to 
go to electric clubs. 

Not only were there no electric clubs on Lamuella, there were no 
clubs at all and, in fact, no electricity. There was a forge and a bakery, 
a few carts and a well, but those were the high water mark of 
Lamuellan technology, and a fair number of Random's unquenchable 
rages were directed against the sheer incomprehensible 
backwardness of the place. 

She could pick up Sub-Etha TV on a small Flex-O-Panel which had 
been surgically implanted in her wrist, but that didn't cheer her up at 
all because it was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in 
every other part of the Galaxy than here. It would also give her 
frequent news of her mother, who had dumped her to go off and 
cover some war which now seemed not to have happened, or at least 
to have gone all wrong in some way because of the absence of any 
proper intelligence gathering. It also gave her access to lots of great 
adventure shows featuring all sorts of fantastically expensive 
spaceships crashing into each other. 

The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful 
magic images flashing over her wrist. They had only ever seen one 
spaceship crash, and it had been so frightening, violent and shocking 
and had caused so much horrible devastation, fire and death that, 
stupidly, they had never realised it was entertainment. 

Old Thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had instantly 
seen Random as an emissary from Bob, but had fairly soon afterwards 
decided that in fact she had been sent as a test of his faith, if not of 
his patience. He was also alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes 
he had to start incorporating into his holy stories if he was to hold the 
attention of the villagers, and not have them rushing off to peer at 
Random's wrist all the time. 



At the moment she was not peering at her wrist. Her wrist was 
turned off. Arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see what she 
was looking at. 

It was his watch. He had taken it off when he'd gone to shower 
under the local waterfall, and Random had found it and was trying to 
work it out. 

"It's just a watch," he said. "It's to tell the time." 

"I know that," she said. "But you keep on fiddling with it, and it still 
doesn't tell the right time. Or even anything like it." 

She brought up the display on her wrist panel, which automatically 
produced a readout of local time. Her wrist panel had quietly got on 
with the business of measuring the local gravity and orbital 
momentum, and had noticed where the sun was and tracked its 
movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes of Random's 
arrival. It had then quickly picked up clues from its environment as to 
what the local unit conventions were and reset itself appropriately. It 
did this sort of thing continually, which was particularly valuable if 
you did a lot of travelling in time as well as space. 

Random frowned at her father's watch, which didn't do any of this. 

Arthur was very fond of it. It was a better one than he would ever 
have afforded himself. He had been given it on his twenty-second 
birthday by a rich and guilt-ridden godfather who had forgotten every 
single birthday he had had up till then, and also his name. It had the 
day, the date, the phases of the moon; it had "To Albert on his 
twenty-first birthday" and the wrong date engraved on the battered 
and scratched surface of its back in letters that were still just about 
visible. 

The watch had been through a considerable amount of stuff in the 
last few years, most of which would fall well outside the warranty. He 
didn't suppose, of course, that the warranty had especially mentioned 
that the watch was guaranteed to be accurate only within the very 
particular gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and so long 
as the day was twenty-four hours long and the planet didn't explode 
and so on. These were such basic assumptions that even the lawyers 
would have missed them. 

Luckily his watch was a wind-up one, or at least, a self-winder. 
Nowhere else in the Galaxy would he have found batteries of 



precisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly 
standard on Earth. 

"So what are all these numbers?" asked Random. 

Arthur took it from her. 

"These numbers round the edge mark the hours. In the little 
window on the right it says THU, which means Thursday, and the 
number is 14, which means it's the fourteenth day of the month of 
MAY which is what it says in this window over here. 

"And this sort of crescent-shaped window at the top tells you 
about the phases of the moon. In other words it tells you how much 
of the moon is lit up at night by the sun, which depends on the 
relative positions of the Sun and the Moon and, well... the Earth." 

"The Earth," said Random. 

"Yes." 

"And that's where you came from, and where Mum came from." 

"Yes." 

Random took the watch back from him and looked at it again, 
clearly baffled by something. Then she held it up to her ear and 
listened in puzzlement. 

"What's that noise?" 

"It's ticking. That's the mechanism that drives the watch. It's called 
clockwork. It's all kind of interlocking cogs and springs that work to 
turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to mark the hours and 
minutes and days and so on." 

Random carried on peering at it. 

"There's something puzzling you," said Arthur. "What is it?" 

"Yes," said Random, at last. "Why's it all in hardware?" 

Arthur suggested they went for a walk. He felt there were things 
they should discuss, and for once Random seemed, if not precisely 
amenable and willing, then at least not growling. 

From Random's point of view this was also all very weird. It wasn't 
that she wanted to be difficult, as such, it was just that she didn't 
know how or what else to be. 

Who was this guy? What was this life she was supposed to lead? 
What was this world she was supposed to lead it in? And what was 



this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes and ears? 

What was it for? What did it want? 

She'd been born in a spaceship that had been going from 
somewhere to somewhere else, and when it had got to somewhere 
else, somewhere else had only turned out to be another somewhere 
that you had to get to somewhere else again from, and so on. 

It was her normal expectation that she was supposed to be 
somewhere else. It was normal for her to feel that she was in the 
wrong place. 

Then, constant time travel had only compounded this problem, and 
had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the wrong place, 
but she was also almost always there at the wrong time. 

She didn't notice that she felt this, because it was the only way she 
ever felt, just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere 
she went she needed either to wear weights or anti-gravity suits and 
usually special apparatus for breathing as well. The only places you 
could ever feel right were worlds you designed for yourself to inhabit- 
virtual realities in the electric clubs. It had never occurred to her that 
the real Universe was something you could actually fit into. 

And that included this Lamuella place her mother had dumped her 
in. And it also included this person who had bestowed on her this 
precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade. It was 
just as well he had turned out to be rather kind and friendly or there 
would have been trouble. Really. She'd got a specially sharpened 
stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble with. 

It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point 
of view without the proper training. 

They sat on the spot that Arthur particularly liked, on the side of a 
hill overlooking the valley. The sun was going down over the village. 

The only thing that Arthur wasn't quite so fond of was being able to 
see a little way into the next valley, where a deep dark mangled 
furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship had crashed. But 
maybe that was what kept bringing him back here. There were plenty 
of spots from which you could survey the lush rolling countryside of 
Lamuella, but this was the one he was drawn to, with its nagging dark 
spot of fear and pain nestling just on the edge of his vision. 



He had never been there again since he had been pulled out of the 
wreckage. 

Wouldn't. 

Couldn't bear it. 

In fact he had gone some of the way back to it the very next day, 
while he was still numb and spinning with shock. He had a broken leg, 
a couple of broken ribs, some bad burns and was not really thinking 
coherently but had insisted that the villagers take him, which, 
uneasily, they had. He had not managed to get right to the actual spot 
where the ground had bubbled and melted, however, and had at last 
hobbled away from the horror for ever. 

Soon, word had got around that the whole area was haunted and 
no one had ventured back there ever since. The land was full of 
beautiful, verdant and delightful valleys - no point in going to a highly 
worrying one. Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move 
forward into the future. 

Random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it to let the 
long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs 
of the thick glass. It fascinated her watching the spidery little second 
hand ticking its way round. Every time it completed a full circle, the 
longer of the two main hands had moved on exactly to the next of the 
sixty small divisions round the dial. And when the long hand had 
made its own full circle, the smaller hand had moved on to the next of 
the main digits. 

"You've been watching it for over an hour." said Arthur, quietly. 

"I know, she said. "An hour is when the big hand has gone all the 
way round, yes?" 

"That's right." 

"Then I've been watching it for an hour and seventeen... minutes." 

She smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure and moved very 
slightly so that she was resting just a little. Against his arm. Arthur felt 
a small sigh escape from him that had been pent up inside his chest 
for weeks. He wanted to put his arm around his daughter's shoulders, 
but felt it was too early yet and that she would shy away from him. 

But something was working. Something was easing inside her. The 
watch meant something to her that nothing in her life had so far 



managed to do. Arthur was not sure that he had really understood 
what it was yet, but he was profoundly pleased and relieved that 
something had reached her. 

"Explain to me again," said Random. 

"There's nothing really to it," said Arthur. "Clockwork was 
something that developed over hundreds of years..." 

"Earth years." 

"Yes. It became finer and finer and more and more intricate. It was 
highly skilled and delicate work. It had to be made very small, and it 
had to carry on working accurately however much you waved it 
around or dropped it." 

"But only on one planet?" 

"Well, that was where it was made, you see. It was never expected 
to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and moons and 
magnetic fields and things. I mean the thing still goes perfectly well, 
but it doesn't really mean much this far from Switzerland." 

"From where?" 

"Switzerland. That's where these were made. Small hilly country. 
Tiresomely neat. The people who made them didn't really know there 
were other worlds." 

"Quite a big thing not to know." 

"Well, yes." 

"So where did they come from?" 

"They, that is we... we just sort of grew there. We evolved on the 
Earth. From, I don't know, some kind of sludge or something." 

"Like this watch." 

"Urn. I don't think the watch grew out of sludge." 

"You don't understand!" 

Random suddenly leaped to her feet, shouting. 

"You don't understand! You don't understand me, you don't 
understand anything! I hate you for being so stupid!" 

She started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching the watch 
and shouting that she hated him. 

Arthur jumped up, startled and at a loss. Fie started to run after her 
through the stringy and clumpy grass. It was hard and painful for him. 
When he had broken his leg in the crash, it had not been a clean 



break, and it had not healed cleanly. He was stumbling and wincing as 
he ran. 

Suddenly she turned and faced him, her face dark with anger. 

She brandished the watch at him. "You don't understand that 
there's somewhere this belongs? Somewhere it works? Somewhere 
that it fits?" 

She turned and ran again. She was fit and fleet-footed and Arthur 
could not remotely keep up with her. 

It wasn't that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult, 
it was that he hadn't expected to be a father at all, particularly not 
suddenly and unexpectedly on an alien planet. 

Random turned to shout at him again. For some reason he stopped 
each time she did. 

"Who do you think I am?" she demanded angrily. "Your upgrade? 
Who do you think Mum thought I was? Some sort of ticket to the life 
she didn't have?" 

"I don't know what you mean by that," said Arthur, panting and 
hurting. 

"You don't know what anybody means by anything!" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" 

"Tell me! Please tell me! What does she mean by saying the life she 
didn't have?" 

"She wished she'd stayed on Earth! She wished she hadn't gone off 
with that stupid brain-dead fruit gum, Zaphod! She thinks she would 
have had a different life!" 

"But," said Arthur, "she would have been killed! She would have 
been killed when the world was destroyed!" 

"That's a different life isn't it?" 

"That’s..." 

"She wouldn't have had to have me! She hates me!" 

"You can't mean that! How could anyone possibly, er, I mean..." 

"She had me because I was meant to make things fit for her. That 
was my job. But I fitted even worse than she did! So she just shut me 
off and carried on with her stupid life." 



"What's stupid about her life? She's fantastically successful, isn't 
she? She's all over time and space, all over the Sub-Etha TV 
networks..." 

"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!" 

Random turned and ran off again. Arthur couldn't keep up with her 
and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his leg 
subside. The turmoil in his head he didn't know what to do with at all. 

He hobbled into the village an hour later. It was getting dark. The 
villagers he passed said hello, but there was a sense of nervousness 
and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about it in 
the air. Old Thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard a fair bit 
and looking at the moon, and that was not a good sign either. 

Arthur went into his hut. 

Random was sitting hunched quietly over the table. 

"I'm sorry," she said. "I'm so sorry." 

"That's all right," said Arthur as gently as he knew how. "It's good 
to, well, to have a little chat. There's so much we have to learn and 
understand about each other, and life isn't, well it isn't all just tea and 
sandwiches..." 

"I'm so sorry," she said again, sobbing. 

Arthur went up to her and put his arm round her shoulder. She 
didn't resist or pull away. Then Arthur saw what it was she was so 
sorry about. 

In the pool of light thrown by a Lamuellan lantern lay Arthur's 
watch. Random had forced the back off it with the back edge of the 
butter spreading knife, and all of the minute cogs and springs and 
levers were lying in a tiny cock-eyed mess where she'd been fiddling 
with them. 

"I just wanted to see how it worked," said Random, "how it all 
fitted together. I'm so sorry! I can't get it back together. I'm sorry, I'm 
sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'll get it repaired! Really! I'll 
get it repaired!" 

The following day Thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of Bob 
stuff. He tried to exert a calming influence by inviting Random to let 
her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the giant earwig, and 



Random said there was no giant earwig and Thrashbarg went very 
cold and silent and said she would be cast into outer darkness. 
Random said good, she'd been born there, and the next day the 
parcel arrived. 

This was all getting a bit eventful. 

In fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot drone 
that dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises, it brought 
with it a sense which gradually began to permeate through the whole 
village, that it was almost one event too many. 

It wasn't the robot drone's fault. All it required was Arthur Dent's 
signature or thumb print, or just a few scrapings of skin cells from the 
nape of his neck and it would be on its way again. It hung around 
waiting, not quite sure what all this resentment was about. 
Meanwhile, Kirp had caught another fish with a head at both ends, 
but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in fact two fish cut in 
half and sewn together rather badly, so not only had Kirp failed to 
rekindle any great interest in two-headed fish but he had seriously 
cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one. Only the pikka birds 
seemed to feel that everything was exactly normal. 

The robot drone got Arthur's signature and made its escape. Arthur 
bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at it. 

"Let's open it!" said Random, who was feeling much more cheerful 
this morning now that everything around her had got thoroughly 
weird, but Arthur said no. 

"Why not?" 

"It's not addressed to me." 

"Yes, it is." 

"No, it isn't. It's addressed to... well, it's addressed to Ford Prefect, 
in care of me." 

"Ford Prefect? Is he the one who..." 

"Yes," said Arthur tartly. 

"I've heard about him." 

"I expect you have." 

"Let's open it anyway. What else are we going to do?" 



"I don't know," said Arthur, who really wasn't sure. He had taken 
his damaged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning 
and Strinder had had a look at them and said that he would see what 
he could do. 

They had tried the usual business of waving the knives through the 
air, feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex and so on, 
but the joy was gone from it, and Arthur had a sad feeling that his 
sandwich making days were probably numbered. 

He hung his head. 

The next appearance of the Perfectly Normal Beasts was imminent, 
but Arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting and feasting were 
going to be rather muted and uncertain. Something had happened 
here on Lamuella, and Arthur had a horrible feeling that it was him. 

"What do you think it is?" urged Random, turning the parcel over in 
her hands. 

"I don't know, said Arthur. "Something bad and worrying, though." 

"How do you know?" Random protested. 

"Because anything to do with Ford Prefect is bound to be worse 
and more worrying than something that isn't," said Arthur. "Believe 
me." 

"You're upset about something, aren't you?" said Random. 

Arthur sighed. 

"I'm just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, I think," said Arthur. 

"I'm sorry," said Random, and put the package down again. She 
could see that it really would upset him if she opened it. She would 
just have to do it when he wasn't looking. 



Chapter 16 


Arthur wasn't quite certain which he noticed as being missing first. 
When he noticed that the one wasn't there his mind instantly leapt to 
the other and he knew immediately that they were both gone and 
that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with would happen 
as a result. 

Random was not there. And neither was the parcel. 

He had left it up on a shelf all day, in plain view. It was an exercise 
in trust. 

He knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent 
was to show trust in his child, to build a sense of trust and confidence 
into the bedrock of relationship between them. He had had a nasty 
feeling that that might be an idiotic thing to do, but he did it anyway, 
and sure enough it had turned out to be an idiotic thing to do. You 
live and learn. At any rate, you live. 

You also panic. 

Arthur ran out of the hut. It was the middle of the evening. The 
light was getting dim and a storm was brewing. He could not see her 
anywhere, nor any sign of her. He asked. No one had seen her. He 
asked again. No one else had seen her. They were going home for the 
night. A little wind was whipping round the edge of the village, picking 
things up and tossing them around in a dangerously casual manner. 

He found Old Thrashbarg and asked him. Thrashbarg looked at him 
stonily, and then pointed in the one direction that Arthur had 
dreaded, and had therefore instinctively known was the way she 
would have gone. 

So now he knew the worst. 

She had gone where she thought he would not follow her. 

He looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked and livid, and 
reflected that it was the sort of sky that the Four Horsemen of the 
Apocalypse wouldn't feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of. 



With a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding he set off on the 
track that led to the forest in the next valley. The first heavy blobs of 
rain began to hit the ground as Arthur tried to drag himself to some 
sort of run. Random reached the crest of the hill and looked down 
into the next valley. It had been a longer and harder climb than she 
had anticipated. She was a little worried that doing the trip at night 
was not that great an idea, but her father had been mooching around 
near the hut all day trying to pretend to either her or himself that he 
wasn't guarding the parcel. At last he'd had to go over to the forge to 
talk with Strinder about the knives, and Random had seized her 
opportunity and done a runner with the parcel. 

It was perfectly clear that she couldn't just open the thing there, in 
the hut, or even in the village. He might have come across her at any 
moment. Which meant that she had to go where she wouldn't be 
followed. 

She could stop where she was now. She had gone this way in the 
hope that he wouldn't follow her. And even if he did he would never 
find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with night drawing in and 
the rain starting. 

All the way up, the parcel had been jiggling under her arm. It was a 
satisfyingly hunky sort of thing: a box with a square top about the 
length of her forearm on each side, and about the length of her hand 
deep, wrapped up in brown plasper with an ingenious new form of 
self-knotting string. It didn't rattle as she shook it, but she sensed that 
its weight was concentrated excitingly at the centre. 

Having come so far, though, there was a certain satisfaction in not 
stopping here, but carrying on down into what seemed to be almost a 
forbidden area - where her father's ship had come down. She wasn't 
exactly certain what the word "haunted" meant, but it might be fun 
to find out. She would keep going and save the parcel up for when 
she got there. 

It was getting darker, though. She hadn't used her tiny electric 
torch yet, because she didn't want to be visible from a distance. She 
would have to use it now, but it probably didn't matter since she 
would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys from 
each other. 

She turned her torch on. Almost at the same moment a fork of 
lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading and 



startled her considerably. As the darkness shuddered back around her 
and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land she felt suddenly 
rather small and lost with just a feeble pencil of light bobbing in her 
hand. Perhaps she should stop after all and open the parcel here. Or 
maybe she should go back and come out again tomorrow. It was only 
a momentary hesitation, though. She knew there was no going back 
tonight, and sensed that there was no going back ever. 

She headed on down the side of the hill. The rain was beginning to 
pick up now. Where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs it 
was settling in for a good pour now, hissing in the trees, and the 
ground was getting slippery under her feet. 

At least, she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees. Shadows 
were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees. 
Onwards and downwards. 

She hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes, soaked to the 
skin now and shivering, and gradually became aware that there 
seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her. It was very 
faint and she wasn't certain if she was imagining it or not. She turned 
off her torch to see. There did seem to be some sort of dim glow 
ahead. She couldn't tell what it was. She turned her torch back on and 
continued down the hill, towards whatever it was. 

There was something wrong with the woods though. 

She couldn't immediately say what it was, but they didn't seem like 
sprightly healthy woods looking forward to a good spring. The trees 
were lolling at sickly angles and had a sort of pallid, blighted look 
about them. Random more than once had the worrying sensation that 
they were trying to reach towards her as she passed them, but it was 
just a trick of the way that her light caused their shadows to flicker 
and lurch. 

Suddenly, something fell out of a tree in front of her. She leapt 
backwards with alarm, dropping both the torch and the box as she did 
so. She went down into a crouch, pulling the specially sharpened rock 
out of her pocket. 

The thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving. The torch was 
lying on the ground and pointing towards it, and a vast, grotesque 
shadow was slowly lurching through the light towards her. She could 
hear faint rustling and screeching noises over the steady hiss of the 



rain. She scrabbled on the ground for the torch, found it, and shone it 
directly at the creature. 

At the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few feet 
away. She swung the torch wildly from one to another. She held her 
rock up, ready to throw. 

They were quite small in fact. It was the angle of the light that had 
made them loom so large. Not only small. But small, furry and cuddly. 
And there was another, dropping from the trees. It fell through the 
beam of light, so she saw it quite clearly. 

It fell neatly and precisely, turned, and then, like the other two, 
started slowly and purposefully to advance on Random. 

She stayed rooted to the spot. She still had her rock. Poised and 
ready to throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the 
things she had it poised and ready to throw at were squirrels. Or at 
least, squirrel-like things. Soft, warm, cuddly squirrel-like things 
advancing on her in a way she wasn't at all certain she liked. 

She shone her torch directly on the first of them. It was making 
aggressive, hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying in one of its 
little fists a small tattered piece of wet, pink rag. Random hefted her 
rock menacingly in her hand, but it made no impression at all on the 
squirrel advancing on her with its wet piece of rag. 

She backed away. She didn't know at all how to deal with this. If 
they had been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening fangs 
she would have pitched into them with a will, but squirrels behaving 
like this she couldn't quite handle. 

She backed away again. The second squirrel was starting to make a 
flanking manoeuvre round to her right. Carrying a cup. Some kind of 
acorn thing. The third was right behind it and making its own advance. 
What was it carrying? Some little scrap of soggy paper. Random 
thought. 

She stepped back again, caught her ankle against the root of a tree 
and fell over backwards. 

Instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of her, 
advancing along her stomach with cold purpose. In its eyes, and a 
piece of wet rag in its fist. 

Random tried to jump up, but only managed to jump about an inch. 
The startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach startled her in 



return. The squirrel froze, gripping her skin through her soaking shirt 
with its tiny claws. Then slowly, inch by inch, it made its way up her, 
stopped, and proffered her the rag. 

She felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its 
tiny glinting eyes. It proffered her the rag again. It pushed it at her 
repeatedly, screeching insistently, till at last, nervously, hesitantly, she 
took the thing from it. It continued to watch her intently, its eyes 
darting all over her face. She had no idea what to do. Rain and mud 
were streaming down her face and she had a squirrel sitting on her. 
She wiped some mud out of her eyes with the rag. 

The squirrel shrieked triumphantly, grabbed the rag back, leapt off 
her, ran scampering into the dark, enclosing night, darted up into a 
tree, dived into a hole in the trunk, settled back and lit a cigarette. 

Meanwhile Random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the 
acorn cup full of rain and the one with the paper. She shuffled 
backwards on her bottom. 

"No!" she shouted. "Go away!" 

They darted back, in fright, and then darted right forward again 
with their gifts. She brandished her rock at them. "Go!" she yelled. 

The squirrels scampered round in consternation. Then one darted 
straight at her, dropped the acorn cup in her lap, turned and ran off 
into the night. The other stood quivering for a moment, then put its 
scrap of paper neatly down in front of her and disappeared as well. 

She was alone again, but trembling with confusion. She got 
unsteadily to her feet, picked up her rock and her parcel, then paused 
and picked up the scrap of paper as well. It was so soggy and 
dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was. It seemed just to be 
a fragment of an in-flight magazine. 

Just as Random was trying to understand exactly what it was that 
this all meant, a man walked out into the clearing in which she was 
standing, raised a vicious-looking gun and shot her. 

Arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind 
her, on the upward side of the hill. 

Within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and 
equipped himself with a lamp. Not an electric one. The only electric 
light in the place was the one that Random had brought with her. This 



was a kind of dim hurricane lamp: a perforated metal canister from 
Strinder's forge, which contained a reservoir of inflammable fish oil, a 
wick of knotted dried grass and was wrapped in a translucent film 
made from dried membranes from the gut of a Perfectly Normal 
Beast. 

It had now gone out. 

Arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way 
for a few seconds. There was clearly no way he was going to get the 
thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the middle of a rainstorm, 
but it's impossible not to make a token effort. Reluctantly he threw 
the thing aside. 

What to do? This was hopeless. He was absolutely sodden, his 
clothes heavy and billowing with the rain, and now he was lost in the 
dark as well. 

For a brief second he was lost in the blinding light, and then he was 
lost in the dark again. 

The sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was very 
close to the brow of the hill. Once he had breasted that he would... 
well, he wasn't certain what he would do. He'd have to work that out 
when he got there. 

He limped forward and upwards. 

A few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at the 
top. There was some kind of dim glow in the distance below him. He 
had no idea what it was, and indeed he hardly liked to think. It was 
the only thing he had to make towards, though, so he started to make 
his way, stumbling, lost and frightened towards it. 

The flash of lethal light passed straight through Random and, about 
two seconds later, so did the man who had shot it. Other than that he 
paid her no attention whatsoever. He had shot someone standing 
behind her, and when she turned to look, he was kneeling over the 
body and going through its pockets. 

The tableau froze and vanished. It was replaced a second later by a 
giant pair of teeth framed by immense and perfectly glossed red lips. 
A huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to 
scrub at the teeth, which continued to hang there gleaming in the 
shimmering curtain of rain. 



Random blinked at it twice before she got it. 

It was a commercial. The guy who had shot her was part of a 
holographic in-flight movie. She must now be very close to where the 
ship had crashed. Obviously some of its systems were more 
indestructible than others. 

The next half-mile of the journey was particularly troublesome. Not 
only did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with, 
but also the fractured and thrashing remains of the ship's on-board 
entertainment system. Spaceships and jetcars and helipods crashed 
and exploded continuously around her, illuminating the night, 
villainous people in strange hats smuggled dangerous drugs through 
her, and the combined orchestra and chorus of the Hallapolis State 
Opera performed the closing March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard 
from Act IV of Rizgar's Blamwellamum of Woont in a little glade 
somewhere off to her left. 

And then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty looking and 
bubbly-edged crater. There was still a faint warm glow coming from 
what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece of 
caramelised chewing gum in the centre of the pit: the melted remains 
of a great spaceship. 

She stood looking at it for a longish while, and then at last started 
to walk along and around the edge of the crater. She was no longer 
certain what she was looking for, but kept moving anyway, keeping 
the horror of the pit to her left. 

The rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still extremely 
wet, and since she didn't know what it was that was in the box, 
whether it was perhaps something delicate or damageable, she 
thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry to open it. She 
hoped she hadn't already damaged it by dropping it. 

She played her torch around the surrounding trees, which were 
thin on the ground here, and mostly charred and broken. In the 
middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock 
which might provide some shelter, and she started to pick her way 
towards it. All around she found the detritus that had been ejected 
from the ship as it broke up, before the final fireball. 

After she had moved two or three hundred yards from the edge of 
the crater she came across the tattered fragments of some fluffy pink 
material, sodden, muddied and drooping amongst the broken trees. 



She guessed, correctly, that this must be the remains of the escape 
cocoon that had saved her father's life. She went and looked at it 
more closely, and then noticed something close to it on the ground, 
half covered in mud. 

She picked it up and wiped the mud off it. It was some kind of 
electronic device the size of a small book. Feebly glowing on its cover, 
in response to her touch, were some large friendly letters. They said 
DON'T PANIC. She knew what this was. It was her father's copy of The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

She felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the 
thundery sky and let some. Rain wash over her face and into her 
mouth. 

She shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks. Clambering 
up and over them she almost immediately found the perfect thing. 
The mouth of a cave. She played her torch into its interior. It seemed 
to be dry and safe. Picking her way carefully, she walked in. It was 
quite spacious, but didn't go that deep. Exhausted and relieved she 
sat on a convenient rock, put the box down in front of her and started 
immediately to open it. 



Chapter 17 


For a long period of time there was much speculation and 
controversy about where the so-called "missing matter" of the 
Universe had got to. All over the Galaxy the science departments of 
all the major universities were acquiring more and more elaborate 
equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant galaxies, and 
then the very centre and the very edges of the whole Universe, but 
when eventually it was tracked down it turned out in fact to be all the 
stuff which the equipment had been packed in. 

There was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box, little 
soft round white pellets of missing matter, which Random discarded 
for future generations of physicists to track down and discover all 
over again once the findings of the current generation of physicists 
had been lost and forgotten about. 

Out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless black 
disk. She put it down on a rock beside her and sifted amongst all the 
missing matter to see if there was anything else, a manual or some 
attachments or something, but there was nothing else at all. Just the 
black disk. 

She shone the torch on it. 

As she did so, cracks began to appear along its apparently 
featureless surface. Random backed away nervously, but then saw 
that the thing, whatever it was, was merely unfolding itself. 

The process was wonderfully beautiful. It was extraordinarily 
elaborate but also simple and elegant. It was like a piece of self¬ 
opening origami, or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just a few 
seconds. 

Where just a few moments earlier there had been a smoothly 
curved black disk there was now a bird. A bird, hovering there. 

Random continued to back away from it, carefully and watchfully. 

It was a little like a pikka bird, only rather smaller. That is to say, in 
fact it was larger, or to be more exact, precisely the same size or, at 



least, not less than twice the size. It was also both a lot bluer and a lot 
pinker than pikka birds, while at the same time being perfectly black. 

There was also something very odd about it, which Random 
couldn't immediately make out. 

It certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave that it 
was watching something that you couldn't see. 

Suddenly it vanished. 

Then, just as suddenly everything went black. Random dropped 
into a tense crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her 
pocket again. Then the blackness receded and rolled itself up into a 
ball and then the blackness was the bird again. It hung in the air in 
front of her, beating its wings slowly and staring at her. 

"Excuse me," it said suddenly, "I just have to calibrate myself. Can 
you hear me when I say this?" 

"When you say what?" demanded Random. 

"Good," said the bird. "And can you hear me when I say this?" It 
spoke this time at a much higher pitch. 

"Yes, of course I can!" said Random. 

"And can you hear me when I say this?" it said, this time in a 
sepulchrally deep voice. 

"Yes!" 

There was then a pause. 

"No obviously not," said the bird after a few seconds. "Good, well 
your hearing range is obviously between 20 and 16 KHz. So. Is this 
comfortable for you?" it said in a pleasant light tenor. "No 
uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register? 
Obviously not. Good. I can use those as data channels. Now. How 
many of me can you see?" 

Suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds. Random 
was well used to spending time in virtual realities, but this was 
something far weirder than anything she had previously encountered. 
It was as if the whole geometry of space was redefined in seamless 
bird shapes. 

Random gasped and flung her arms round her face, her arms 
moving through bird-shaped space. 



"Hmmm, obviously way too many," said the bird. "How about 
now?" 

It concertinaed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird caught 
between parallel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the distance. 

"What are you?" shouted Random. 

"We'll come to that in a minute," said the bird. "Just how many, 
please?" 

"Well, you're sort of..." Random gestured helplessly off into the 
distance. 

"I see, still infinite in extent, but at least we're homing in on the 
right dimensional matrix. Good. No, the answer is an orange and two 
lemons." 

"Lemons?" 

"If I have three lemons and three oranges and I lose two oranges 
and a lemon what do I have left?" 

"Huh?" 

"OK, so you think that time flows that way, do you? Interesting. Am 
I still infinite?" it asked, ballooning this way and that in space. "Am I 
infinite now? How yellow am I?" 

Moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling 
transformations of shape and extent. 

"I can't..." said Random bewildered. 

"You don't have to answer, I can tell from watching you now. So. 
Am I your mother? Am I a rock? Do I seem huge, squishy and 
sinuously intertwined? No? How about now? Am I going backwards?" 

For once the bird was perfectly still and steady. 

"No," said Random. 

"Well I was in fact, I was moving backwards in time. Hmmm. Well I 
think we've sorted all that out now. If you'd like to know, I can tell you 
that in your universe you move freely in three dimensions that you 
call space. You move in a straight line in a fourth, which you call time, 
and stay rooted to one place in a fifth, which is the first fundamental 
of probability. After that it gets a hit complicated, and there's all sorts 
of stuff going on in dimensions 13 to 22 that you really wouldn't want 
to know about. All you really need to know for the moment is that the 
universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you 



start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the 
first place. I can easily not say words like 'damn' if it offends you." 

"Say what you damn well like." 

"I will." 

"What the hell are you?" demanded Random. 

"I am The Guide. In your universe I am your Guide. In fact I inhabit 
what is technically known as the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash 
which means... well, let me show you." 

It turned in mid-air and swooped out of the cave, and then perched 
on a rock, just beneath an overhang, out of the rain, which was 
getting heavier again. 

"Come on," it said, "watch this." 

Random didn't like being bossed around by a bird, but she followed 
it to the mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the rock in her 
pocket. 

"Rain," said the bird. "You see? Just rain." 

"I know what rain is." 

Sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night, moonlight 
sifting through it. 

"So what is it?" 

"What do you mean, what is it? Look, who are you? What were you 
doing in that box? Why have I spent a night running through the 
forest fending off demented squirrels to find that all I've got at the 
end of it is a bird asking me what rain is. It's just water falling through 
the bloody air, that's what it is. Anything else you want to know or 
can we go home now?" 

There was a long pause before the bird answered, "You want to go 
home?" 

"I haven't got a home!" Random almost shocked herself, she 
screamed the words so loudly. 

"Look into the rain..." said the bird Guide. 

"I'm looking into the rain! What else is there to look at?" 

"What do you see?" 

"What do you mean, you stupid bird? I just see a load of rain. It's 
just water, falling." 

"What shapes do you see in the water?" 



"Shapes? There aren't any shapes. It's just, just..." 

"Just a mish mash," said the bird Guide. 

"Yes..." 

"Now what do you see?" 

Just on the very edge of visibility a thin faint beam fanned out of 
the bird's eyes. In the dry air beneath the overhang there was nothing 
to see. Where the beam hit the drops of rain as they fell through it, 
there was a flat sheet of light, so bright and vivid it seemed solid. 

"Oh great. A laser show," said Random fractiously. "Never seen one 
of those before, of course, except at about five million rock concerts." 

"Tell me what you see!" 

"Just a flat sheet! Stupid bird." 

"There's nothing there that wasn't there before. I'm just using light 
to draw your attention to certain drops at certain moments. Now 
what do you see?" 

The light shut off. 

"Nothing." 

"I'm doing exactly the same thing, but with ultra-violet light. You 
can't see it." 

"So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?" 

"So that you understand that just because you see something, it 
doesn't mean to say it's there. And if you don't see something it 
doesn't mean to say it's not there, it's only what your senses bring to 
your attention." 

"I'm bored with this," said Random, and then gasped. 

Hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three-dimensional 
image of her father looking startled about something. 

About two miles away behind Random, her father, struggling his 
way through the woods suddenly stopped. He was startled to see an 
image of himself looking startled about something hanging brightly in 
the rain-filled air about two miles away. About two miles away some 
distance to the right of the direction in which he was heading. 

He was almost completely lost, convinced he was going to die of 
cold and wet and exhaustion and beginning to wish he could just get 



on with it. He had just been brought an entire golfing magazine by a 
squirrel, as well, and his brain, was beginning to howl and gibber. 

Seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told him 
that, on balance, he was probably right to howl and gibber but 
probably wrong as far as the direction he was heading was concerned. 

Taking a deep breath, he turned and headed off towards the 
inexplicable light show. 

"OK, so what's that supposed to prove?" demanded Random. It 
was the fact that the image was her father that had startled her 
rather than the appearance of the image itself. She had seen her first 
hologram when she was two months old and had been put in it to 
play. She had seen her most recent one about half an hour ago 
playing the March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard. 

"Only that it's no more there or not there than the sheet was," said 
the bird. "It's just the interaction of water from the sky moving in one 
direction, with light at frequencies your senses can detect moving in 
another. It makes an apparently solid image in your mind. But it's all 
just images in the Mish Mash. Here's another one for you." 

"My mother!" said Random. 

"No," said the bird. 

"I know my mother when I see her!" 

The image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft inside a 
large, grey hangar-like building. She was being escorted by a group of 
tall, thin purplish-green creatures. It was definitely Random's mother. 
Well, almost definitely. Trillian wouldn't have been walking quite so 
uncertainly in low gravity, or looking around her at a boring old life- 
support environment with quite such a disbelieving look on her face, 
or carrying such a quaint old camera. 

"So who is it?" demanded Random. 

"She is part of the extent of your mother on the probability axis," 
said the bird Guide. 

"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean." 

"Space, time and probability all have axes along which it is possible 
to move." 

"Still dunno. Though I think... No. Explain." 



"I thought you wanted to go home." 

"Explain!" 

"Would you like to see your home?" 

"See it? It was destroyed!" 

"It is discontinuous along the probability axis. Look!" 

Something very strange and wonderful now swam into view in the 
rain. It was a huge, bluish-greenish globe, misty and cloud-covered, 
turning with, majestic slowness against a black, starry background. 

"Now you see it," said the bird. "Now you don't." 

A little less than two miles away, now, Arthur Dent stood still in his 
tracks. He could not believe what he could see, hanging there, 
shrouded in rain, but brilliant and vividly real against the night sky - 
the Earth. He gasped at the sight of it. Then, at the moment he 
gasped, it disappeared again. Then it appeared again. Then, and this 
was the bit that made him give up and stick straws in his hair, it 
turned into a sausage. 

* * * 

Random was also startled by the sight of this huge, blue and green 
and watery and misty sausage hanging above her. And now it was a 
string of sausages, or rather it was a string of sausages in which many 
of the sausages were missing. The whole brilliant string turned and 
span in a bewildering dance in the air and then gradually slowed, 
grew insubstantial and faded into the glistening darkness of the night. 

"What was that?" asked Random, in a small voice. 

"A glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously probable 
object." 

"I see." 

"Most objects mutate and change along their axis of probability, 
but the world of your origin does something slightly different. It lies 
on what you might call a fault line in the landscape of probability 
which means that at many probability co-ordinates, the whole of it 
simply ceases to exist. It has an inherent instability, which is typical of 
anything that lies within what are usually designated the Plural 
sectors. Make sense?" 

"No." 



"Want to go and see for yourself?" 

"To... Earth?" 

"Yes." 

"Is that possible?" 

The bird Guide did not answer at once. It spread its wings and, with 
an easy grace, ascended into the air and flew out into the rain which, 
once again, was beginning to lighten. 

It soared ecstatically up into the night sky, lights flashed around it, 
dimensions dithered in its wake. It swooped and turned and looped 
and turned again and came at last to rest two feet in front of 
Random's face, its wings beating slowly and silently. 

It spoke to her again. 

"Your universe is vast to you. Vast in time, vast in space. That's 
because of the filters through which you perceive it. But I was built 
with no filters at all, which means I perceive the mish mash which 
contains all possible universes but which has, itself, no size at all. For 
me, anything is possible. I am omniscient and omnipotent, extremely 
vain, and, what is more, I come in a handy self-carrying package. You 
have to work out how much of the above is true." 

A slow smile spread over Random's face. 

"You bloody little thing. You've been winding me up!" 

"As I said, anything is possible." 

Random laughed. "OK," she said. "Let's try and go to Earth. Let's go 
to Earth at some point on its, er..." 

"Probability axis?" 

"Yes. Where it hasn't been blown up. OK. So you're the Guide. How 
do we get a lift?" 

"Reverse engineering." 

"What?" 

"Reverse engineering. To me the flow of time is irrelevant. You 
decide what you want. I then merely make sure that it has already 
happened." 

"You're joking." 

"Anything is possible." 

Random frowned. "You are joking aren't you?" 



"Let me put it another way," said the bird. "Reverse engineering 
enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the 
horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector every 
year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it feels like giving 
you a lift. You want a lift a ship arrives and gives you one. The pilot 
may think he has any one of a million reasons why he has decided to 
stop and pick you up. The real reason is that I have determined that 
he will." 

"This is you being extremely vain isn't it, little bird?" 

The bird was silent. 

"OK," said Random. "I want a ship to take me to Earth." 

"Will this one do?" 

It was so silent that Random had not noticed the descending 
spaceship until it was nearly on top of her. 

Arthur had noticed it. He was a mile away now and closing. Just 
after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion he 
had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out 
of the clouds and had, to begin with, assumed it to be another piece 
of flashy son et lumiere. 

It took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual 
spaceship, and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was 
dropping directly down to where he assumed his daughter to be. That 
was when, rain or no rain, leg injury or no leg injury, darkness or no 
darkness, he suddenly started really to run. 

He fell almost immediately, slid and hurt his knee quite badly on a 
rock. He slithered back up to his feet and tried again. He had a 
horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose Random for ever. 
Limping and cursing, he ran. He didn't know what it was that had 
been in the box, but the name on it had been Ford Prefect, and that 
was the name he cursed as he ran. 

The ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that 
Random had ever seen. 

It was astounding. Silver, sleek, ineffable. 

If she didn't know better she would have said it was an RW6. As it 
settled silently beside her she realised that it actually was an RW6 and 



she could scarcely breathe for excitement. An RW6 was the sort of 
thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that were designed to 
provoke civil unrest. 

She was also extremely nervous. The manner and timing of its 
arrival was deeply unsettling. Either it was the most bizarre 
coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going on. 
She waited a little tensely for the ship's hatch to open. Her Guide - 
she thought of it as hers now - was hovering lightly over her right 
shoulder, its wings barely fluttering. 

The hatch opened. Just a little dim light escaped. A moment or two 
passed and a figure emerged. He stood still for a moment or so, 
obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness. Then he caught 
sight of Random standing there, and seemed a little surprised. He 
started to walk towards her. Then suddenly he shouted in surprise 
and started to run at her. 

Random was not a good person to take a run at on a dark night 
when she was feeling a little strung out. She had unconsciously been 
fingering the rock in her pocket from the moment she saw the craft 
coming down. 

Still running, slithering, hurtling, bumping into trees, Arthur saw at 
last that he was too late. The ship had only been on the ground for 
about three minutes, and now, silently, gracefully it was rising up 
above the trees again, turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to 
which the storm had now abated, climbing, climbing, tipping up its 
nose and, suddenly, effortlessly, hurtling up through the clouds. 

Gone. Random was in it. It was impossible for Arthur to know this, 
but he just went ahead and knew it anyway. She was gone. He had 
had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely believe how badly 
he had done at it. He tried to continue running, but his feet were 
dragging, his knee was hurting like fury and he knew that he was too 
late. 

He could not conceive that he could feel more wretched and awful 
than this, but he was wrong. 

He limped his way at last to the cave where Random had sheltered 
and opened the box. The ground bore the indentations of the 
spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before, but of Random 
there was no sign. He wandered disconsolately into the cave, found 



the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets strewn around the 
place. He felt a little cross about that. He'd tried to teach her about 
cleaning up after herself. Feeling a bit cross with her about something 
like that helped him feel less desolate about her leaving. He knew he 
had no means of finding her. 

His foot knocked against something unexpected. He bent down to 
pick it up, and was thoroughly surprised to discover what it was. It 
was his old Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. How did that come to be 
in the cave? He had never returned to collect it from the scene of the 
crash. He had not wanted to revisit the crash and he had not wanted 
the Guide again. He had reckoned he was here on Lamuella, making 
sandwiches for good. How did it come to be in the cave? It was active. 
The words on the cover flashed DON'T PANIC at him. 

He went out of the cave again into the dim and damp moonlight. 

He sat on a rock to have a look through the old Guide, and then 
discovered it wasn't a rock, it was a person. 



Chapter 18 


Arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear. It would be hard to say 
which he was more frightened of: that he might have hurt the person 
he had inadvertently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently 
sat on would hurt him back. 

There seemed, on inspection, to be little immediate cause for 
alarm on the second count. Whoever it was he had sat on was 
unconscious. That would probably go a great deal of the way towards 
explaining what he was doing lying there. He seemed to be breathing 
OK, though. Arthur felt his pulse. That was OK as well. 

He was lying on his side, half curled up. It was so long ago and far 
away when Arthur had last done First Aid that he really couldn't 
remember what it was he was supposed to do. The first thing he was 
supposed to do, he remembered, was to have a First Aid kit about his 
person. Damn. 

Should he roll him on to his back or not? Suppose he had any 
broken bones? Suppose he swallowed his tongue? Suppose he sued 
him? Who, apart from anything else, was he? 

At that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and rolled 
himself over. 

Arthur wondered if he should. 

He looked at him. 

He looked at him again. 

He looked at him again, just to make absolutely sure. 

Despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling about as 
low as he possibly could, he experienced a terrible sinking feeling. 

The figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes. It took him a 
while to focus, then he blinked and stiffened. 

"You!" said Ford Prefect. 

"You!" said Arthur Dent. 

Ford groaned again. 



"What do you need to have explained this time?" he said, and 
closed his eyes in some kind of despair. 

* * * 

Five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side of his 
head, where he had quite a large swelling. 

"Who the hell was that woman?" he said. "Why are we surrounded 
by squirrels, and what do they want?" 

"I've been pestered by squirrels all night," said Arthur. "They keep 
on trying to give me magazines and stuff." 

Ford frowned. "Really?" he said. 

"And bits of rag." 

Ford thought. 

"Oh," he said. "Is this near where your ship crashed?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. Fie said it a little tightly. 

"That's probably it. Can happen. Ship's cabin robots get destroyed. 
The cyberminds that control them survive and start infesting the local 
wildlife. Can turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless 
thrashing service industry, handing out hot towels and drinks to 
passers-by. Should be a law against it. Probably is. Probably also a law 
against there being a law against it so everybody can get nice and 
worked up. Fley ho. What did you say?" 

"I said, and the woman is my daughter." 

Ford stopped rubbing his head. 

"Say that one more time." 

"I said," said Arthur huffily, "the woman is my daughter." 

"I didn't know," said Ford, "that you had a daughter." 

"Well, there's probably a lot you don't know about me," said Arthur. 
"Come to mention it, there's probably a lot I don't know about me 
either." 

"Well, well, well. When did this happen then?" 

"I'm not quite sure." 

"That sounds like more familiar territory," said Ford. "Is there a 
mother involved?" 

"Trillian." 

"Trillian? I didn't think that..." 



"No. Look, it's a bit embarrassing." 

"I remember she told me once she had a kid but only, sort of, in 
passing. I'm in touch with her from time to time. Never seen her with 
the kid." 

Arthur said nothing. 

Ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement. 

"Are you sure this was your daughter?" he said. 

"Tell me what happened." 

"Phroo. Long story. I was coming to pick up this parcel I'd sent to 
myself here care of you..." 

"Well, what was that all about?" 

"I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous." 

"And you sent it to me?" protested Arthur. 

"Safest place I could think of. I thought I could rely on you to be 
absolutely boring and not open it. Anyway, coming in at night I 
couldn't find this village place. I was going by pretty basic information. 

I couldn't find any signal of any kind. I guess you don't have signals 
and stuff here." 

"That's what I like about it." 

"Then I did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the Guide, 
so I homed in on that, thinking that would take me to you. I found I'd 
landed in some kind of wood. Couldn't figure out what was going on. I 
get out, and then see this woman standing there. I go up to say hello, 
then suddenly I see that she's got this thing!" 

"What thing?" 

"The thing I sent you! The new Guide! The bird thing! You were 
meant to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the thing right 
there by her shoulder. I ran forward and she hit me with a rock." 

"I see," said Arthur. "What did you do?" 

"Well, I fell over of course. I was very badly hurt. She and the bird 
started to make off towards my ship. And when I say my ship, I mean 
an RW6." 

"A what?" 

"An RW6 for Zark's sake. I've got this great relationship going now 
between my credit card and the Guide's central computer. You would 
not believe that ship, Arthur, it's..." 



"So an RW6 is a spaceship, then?" 

"Yes! It's - oh never mind. Look, just get some kind of grip will you, 
Arthur? Or at least get some kind of catalogue. At this point I was very 
worried. And, I think, semi-concussed. I was down on my knees and 
bleeding profusely, so I did the only thing I could think of, which was 
to beg. I said, please for Zark's sake don't take my ship. And don't 
leave me stranded in the middle of some primitive zarking forest with 
no medical help and a head injury. I could be in serious trouble and so 
could she." 

"What did she say?" 

"She hit me on the head with the rock again." 

"I think I can confirm that that was my daughter." 

"Sweet kid." 

"You have to get to know her," said Arthur. 

"She eases up does she?" 

"No," said Arthur, "but you get a better sense of when to duck." 

Ford held his head and tried to see straight. 

The sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which was where the 
sun rose. Arthur didn't particularly want to see it. The last thing he 
wanted after a hellish night like this one was some blasted day 
coming along and barging about the place. 

"What are you doing in a place like this, Arthur?" demanded Ford. 

"Well," said Arthur, "making sandwiches mostly." 

"What?" 

"I am, probably was, the sandwich maker for a small tribe. It was a 
bit embarrassing really. When I first arrived, that is, when they 
rescued me from the wreckage of this super high-technology 
spacecraft which had crashed on their planet, they were very nice to 
me and I thought I should help them out a bit. You know, I'm an 
educated chap from a high-technology culture, I could show them a 
thing or two. And of course I couldn't. I haven't got the faintest idea, 
when it comes down to it, of how anything actually works. I don't 
mean like video-recorders, nobody knows how to work those. I mean 
just something like a pen or an artesian well or something. Not the 
foggiest. I couldn't help at all. One day I got glum and made myself a 
sandwich. That suddenly got them all excited. They'd never seen one 
before. It was just an idea that had never occurred to them, and I 



happen to quite like making sandwiches, so it all sort of developed 
from there." 

"And you enjoyed that?" 

"Well, yes, I think I sort of did, really. Getting a good set of knives, 
that sort of thing." 

"You didn't, for instance, find it mind-witheringly, explosively, 
astoundingly, blisteringly dull?" 

"Well, er, no. Not as such. Not actually blisteringly." 

"Odd. I would." 

"Well, I suppose we have a different outlook." 

"Yes." 

"Like the pikka birds." 

Ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldn't be 
bothered to ask. Instead he said, "So how the hell do we get out of 
this place?" 

"Well I think the simplest way from here is just to follow the way 
down the valley to the plains, probably take an hour, and then walk 
round from there. I don't think I could face going back up and over 
the way I came." 

"Walk round where from there?" 

"Well, back to the village. I suppose." Arthur sighed a little forlornly. 

"I don't want to go to any blasted village!" snapped Ford. 

"We've got to get out of here!" 

"Where? How?" 

"I don't know, you tell me. You live here! There must be some way 
off this zarking planet." 

"I don't know. What do you usually do? Sit around and wait for a 
passing spacecraft, I suppose." 

"Oh yes? And how many spacecraft have visited this zark-forsaken 
little fleapit recently?" 

"Well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by 
mistake. Then there was, er, Trillian, then the parcel delivery, and 
now you, and..." 

"Yes, but apart from the usual suspects?" 



"Well, er, I think pretty much none, so far as I know. Pretty quiet 
round here." 

As if deliberately to prove him wrong, there was a long, low distant 
roll of thunder. 

Ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards and 
forwards in the feeble, painful light of the early dawn which lay 
streaked against the sky as if someone had dragged a piece of liver 
across it. 

"You don't understand how important this is," he said. 

"What? You mean my daughter out there all alone in the Galaxy? 
You think I don't..." 

"Can we feel sorry for the Galaxy later?" said Ford. "This is very, 
very serious indeed. The Guide has been taken over. It's been bought 
out." 

Arthur leapt up. "Oh very serious," he shouted. "Please fill me in 
straight away on some corporate publishing politics! I can't tell you 
how much it's been on my mind of late!" 

"You don't understand! There's a whole new Guide!" 

"Oh!" shouted Arthur again. "Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm incoherent with 
excitement! I can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are 
the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in some 
globular cluster I've never heard of. Please, can we rush to a store 
that's got it right this very instant?" 

Ford narrowed his eyes. 

"This is that thing you call sarcasm, isn't it?" 

"Do you know," bellowed Arthur, "I think it is? I really think it might 
just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my 
manner of speech! Ford, I have had a fucking bad night! Will you 
please try and take that into account while you consider what 
fascinating bits of badger-sputumly inconsequential trivia to assail me 
with next?" 

"Try to rest," said Ford. "I need to think." 

"Why do you need to think? Can't we just sit and go budum- 
budumbudum with our lips for a bit? Couldn't we just dribble gently 
and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes? I can't stand it. Ford! I 
can't stand all this thinking and trying to work things out any more. 
You may think that I am just standing here barking..." 



"Hadn't occurred to me in fact." 

"...but I mean it! What is the point? We assume that every time we 
do anything we know what the consequences will be, i.e., more or 
less what we intend them to be. This is not only not always correct. It 
is wildly, crazily, stupidly cross-eyed-blithering-insectly wrong!" 

"Which is exactly my point." 

"Thank you," said Arthur, sitting down again. "What?" 

"Temporal reverse engineering." 

Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to 
side. 

"Is there any humane way," he moaned, "in which I can prevent 
you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody-whatsiting is?" 

"No," said Ford, "because your daughter is caught up in the middle 
of it and it is deadly, deadly serious." 

Thunder rolled in the pause. 

"All right," said Arthur. "Tell me." 

"I leaped out of a high-rise office window." 

This cheered Arthur up. 

"Oh!" he said. "Why don't you do it again?" 

"I did." 

"Hmmm," said Arthur, disappointed. "Obviously no good came of 
it." 

"The first time I managed to save myself by the most astonishing 
and - I say this in all modesty - fabulous piece of ingenious quick¬ 
thinking, agility, fancy footwork and self-sacrifice." 

"What was the self-sacrifice?" 

"I jettisoned half of a much loved and I think irreplaceable pair of 
shoes." 

"Why was that self-sacrifice?" 

"Because they were mine!" said Ford crossly. 

"I think we have different value systems." 

"Well mine's better." 

"That's according to your... oh never mind. So having saved 
yourself very cleverly once you very sensibly went and jumped again. 
Please don't tell me why. Just tell me what happened if you must." 



"I fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet towncar whose 
pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button when he meant 
only to change tracks on the stereo. Now, even I couldn't think that 
that was particularly clever of me." 

"Oh, I don't know," said Arthur wearily. "I expect you probably 
sneaked into his jetcar the previous night and set the pilot's least 
favourite track to play or something." 

"No, I didn't," said Ford. 

"Just checking." 

"Though oddly enough, somebody else did. And this is the nub. You 
could trace the chain and branches of crucial events and coincidences 
back and back. Turned out the new Guide had done it. That bird." 

"What bird?" 

"You haven't seen it?" 

"No." 

"Oh. It's a lethal little thing. Looks pretty, talks big, collapses 
waveforms selectively at will." 

"What does that mean?" 

"Temporal reverse engineering." 

"Oh," said Arthur. "Oh yes." 

"The question is, who is it really doing it for?" 

"I've actually got a sandwich in my pocket," said Arthur, delving. 
"Would you like a bit?" 

"Yeah, OK." 

"It's a bit squished and sodden. I'm afraid." 

"Never mind." 

They munched for a bit. 

"It's quite good in fact," said Ford. "What's the meat in it?" 

"Perfectly Normal Beast." 

"Not come across that one. So, the question is," Ford continued, 
"who is the bird really doing it for? What's the real game here?" 

"Mmm," ate Arthur. 

"When I found the bird," continued Ford, "which I did by a series of 
coincidences that are interesting in themselves, it put on the most 
fantastic multi-dimensional display of pyrotechnics I've ever seen. It 



then said that it would put its services at my disposal in my universe. I 
said, thanks but no thanks. It said that it would anyway, whether I 
liked it or not. I said just try it, and it said it would and, indeed, 
already had done. I said we'd see about that and it said that we would. 
That's when I decided to pack the thing up and get it out of there. So I 
sent it to you for safety." 

"Oh yes? Whose?" 

"Never you mind. Then, what with one thing and another, I thought 
it prudent to jump out of the window again, being fresh out of other 
options at the time. Luckily for me the jetcar was there otherwise I 
would have had to fall back on ingenious quick-thinking, agility, 
maybe another shoe or, failing all else, the ground. But it meant that, 
whether I liked it or not, the Guide was, well, working for me, and 
that was deeply worrying." 

"Why?" 

"Because if you've got the Guide you think that you are the one it's 
working for. Everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then 
on, up to the very moment that I come up against the totty with the 
rock, then, bang, I'm history. I'm out of the loop." 

"Are you referring to my daughter?" 

"As politely as I can. She's the next one in the chain who will think 
that everything is going fabulously for her. She can beat whoever she 
likes around the head with bits of the landscape, everything will just 
swim for her until she's done whatever she's supposed to do and then 
it will be all up for her too. It's reverse temporal engineering, and 
clearly nobody understood what was being unleashed!" 

"Like me for instance." 

"What? Oh, wake up, Arthur. Look, let me try it again. The new 
Guide came out of the research labs. It made use of this new 
technology of Unfiltered Perception. Do you know what that means?" 

"Look, I've been making sandwiches for Bob's sake!" 

"Who's Bob?" 

"Never mind. Just carry on." 

"Unfiltered Perception means it perceives everything. Got that? I 
don't perceive everything. You don't perceive everything. We have 
filters. The new Guide doesn't have any sense filters. It perceives 



everything. It wasn't a complicated technological idea. It was just a 
question of leaving a bit out. Got it?" 

"Why don't I just say that I've got it, and then you can carry on 
regardless." 

"Right. Now because the bird can perceive every possible Universe 
it is present in every possible universe. Yes?" 

"Y... e... e... s. Ish." 

"So what happens is, the bozos in the marketing and accounting 
departments say, oh that sounds good, doesn't that mean we only 
have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite number of times? 
Don't squint at me like that, Arthur, this is how accountants think!" 

"That's quite clever, isn't it?" 

"No! It is fantastically stupid. Look. The machine's only a little 
Guide. It's got some quite clever cybertechnology in it, but because it 
has Unfiltered Perception, any smallest move it makes has the power 
of a virus. It can propagate throughout space, time and a million other 
dimensions. Anything can be focused anywhere in any of the 
universes that you and I move in. Its power is recursive. Think of a 
computer program. Somewhere, there is one key instruction, and 
everything else is just functions calling themselves, or brackets 
billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space. What 
happens when the brackets collapse? Where's the final 'end if'? Is any 
of this making sense? Arthur?" 

"Sorry, I was nodding off for a moment. Something about the 
Universe, yes?" 

"Something about the Universe, yes," said Ford, wearily. He sat 
down again. 

"All right," he said. "Think about this. You know who I think I saw at 
the Guide offices? Vogons. Ah. I see I've said a word you understand 
at last." 

Arthur leapt to his feet. 

"That noise," he said. 

"What noise?" 

"The thunder." 


"What about it?" 



"It isn't thunder. It's the spring migration of the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts. It's started." 

"What are these animals you keep on about?" 

"I don't keep on about them. I just put bits of them in sandwiches." 
"Why are they called Perfectly Normal Beasts?" 

Arthur told him. 

It wasn't often that Arthur had the pleasure of seeing Ford's eyes 
open wide with astonishment. 



Chapter 19 


It was a sight that Arthur never quite got used to, or tired of. He 
and Ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small 
river that flowed down along the bed of the valley, and when at last 
they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into 
the branches of a large tree to get a better view of one of the stranger 
and more wonderful visions that the Galaxy has to offer. 

The great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of Perfectly 
Normal Beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the Anhondo 
Plain. In the early pale light of the morning, as the great animals 
charged through the fine steam of the sweat of their bodies mingled 
with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves, their 
appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway, but what was 
heart-stopping about them was where they came from and where 
they went to, which appeared to be, simply, nowhere. 

They formed a solid, charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards 
wide and half a mile long. The phalanx never moved, except that it 
exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the eight 
or nine days that it regularly appeared for. But though the phalanx 
stayed more or less constant, the great beasts of which it was 
composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an hour, 
appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain, and 
disappearing equally abruptly at the other end. 

No one knew where they came from, no one knew where they 
went. They were so important to the lives of the Lamuellans, it was 
almost as if nobody liked to ask. Old Thrashbarg had said on one 
occasion that some times if you received an answer, the question 
might be taken away. Some of the villagers had privately said that this 
was the only properly wise thing they'd ever heard Thrashbarg say, 
and after a short debate on the matter, had put it down to chance. 

The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense that it was 
hard to hear anything else above it. 



"What did you say?" shouted Arthur. 

"I said," shouted Ford, "this looks like it might be some kind of 
evidence of dimensional drift." 

"Which is what?" shouted Arthur back. 

"Well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space/time is 
showing signs of cracking up with everything that's happening to it. 
There are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the 
landmasses have cracked up and moved around just from the weirdly 
long or meandering routes that migrating animals take. This might be 
something like that. We live in twisted times. Still, in the absence of a 
decent spaceport..." 

Arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way. 

"What do you mean?" he said. 

"What do you mean, what do I mean?" shouted Ford. "You know 
perfectly well what I mean. We're going to ride our way out of here." 

"Are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a Perfectly Normal 
Beast?" 

"Yeah. See where it goes to." 

"We'll be killed! No," said Arthur, suddenly. "We won't be killed. At 
least I won't. Ford, have you ever heard of a planet called Stavromula 
Beta?" 

Ford frowned. "Don't think so," he said. Fie pulled out his own 
battered old copy of the FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and 
accessed it. "Any funny spelling?" he said. 

"Don't know. I've only ever heard it said, and that was by someone 
who had a mouthful of other people's teeth. You remember I told you 
about Agrajag?" 

Ford thought for a moment. "You mean the guy who was 
convinced you were getting him killed over and over again?" 

"Yes. One of the places he claimed I'd got him killed was 
Stavromula Beta. Someone tries to shoot me, it seems. I duck and 
Agrajag, or at least, one of his many reincarnations, gets hit. It seems 
that this has definitely happened at some point in time so, I suppose, I 
can't get killed at least until after I've ducked on Stavromula Beta. 

Only no one's ever heard of it." 

"Flmm." Ford tried a few other searches of the FHitchhiker's Guide, 
but drew a blank. 



"Nothing," he said. 

"I was just... no, I've never heard of it," said Ford finally. He 
wondered why it was ringing a very, very faint bell, though. 

"OK," said Arthur. "I've seen the way the Lamuellan hunters trap 
Perfectly Normal Beasts. If you spear one in the herd it just gets 
trampled, so they have to lure them out one at a time for the kill. It's 
very like the way a matador works, you know, with a brightly coloured 
cape. You get one to charge at you and then step aside and execute a 
rather elegant swing through with the cape. Have you got anything 
like a brightly coloured cape about you?" 

"This do?" said Ford, handing him his towel. 



Chapter 20 


Leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton Perfectly Normal 
Beast migrating through your world at a thundering thirty miles an 
hour is not as easy as it might at first seem. Certainly it is not as easy 
as the Lamuellan hunters made it seem, and Arthur Dent was 
prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the difficult bit. 

What he hadn't been prepared to discover, however, was how 
difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit. It was the bit that was 
supposed to be the easy bit which turned out to be practically 
impossible. 

They couldn't even catch the attention of a single animal. The 
Perfectly Normal Beasts were so intent on working up a good thunder 
with their hooves, heads down shoulders forward, back legs pounding 
the ground into porridge that it would have taken something not 
merely startling but actually geological to disturb them. 

The sheer amount of thundering and pending was, in the end, 
more than Arthur and Ford could deal with. After they had spent 
nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish things with 
a medium-sized floral patterned bath towel, they had not managed to 
get even one of the great beasts thundering and pounding past them 
to do so much as glance casually in their direction. 

They were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of 
sweating bodies. To have been much nearer would have been to risk 
instant death, chronologic or no chronologic. Arthur had seen what 
remained of any Perfectly Normal Beast which, as the result of a 
clumsy misthrow by a young and inexperienced Lamuellan hunter, got 
speared while still thundering and pounding with the herd. 

One stumble was all it took. No prior appointment with death on 
Stavromula Beta, wherever the hell Stavromula Beta was, would save 
you or anybody else from the thunderous, mangling pounding of 
those hooves. 



At last, Arthur and Ford staggered back. They sat down, exhausted 
and defeated, and started to criticise each other's technique with the 
towel. 

"You've got to flick it more," complained Ford. "You need more 
follow-through from the elbow if you're going to get those blasted 
creatures to notice anything at all." 

"Follow-through?" protested Arthur. "You need more suppleness in 
the wrist." 

"You need more after-flourish," countered Ford. 

"You need a bigger towel." 

"You need," said another voice, "a pikka bird." 

"You what?" 

The voice had come from behind them. They turned, and there, 
standing behind them in the early morning sun, was Old Thrashbarg. 

"To attract the attention of a Perfectly Normal Beast," he said, as 
he walked forward towards them, "you need a pikka bird. Like this." 

From under the rough, cassocky robe-like thing he wore he drew a 
small pikka bird. It sat restlessly on Old Thrashbarg's hand and peered 
intently at Bob knows what darting around about three feet six inches 
in front of it. 

Ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do 
when he wasn't quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do 
about it. He waved his arms around very slowly in what he hoped was 
an ominous manner. 

"Who is this?" he hissed. 

"It's just Old Thrashbarg," said Arthur quietly. "And I wouldn't 
bother with all the fancy movements. He's just as experienced a 
bluffer as you are. You could end up dancing around each other all 
day." 

"The bird," hissed Ford again. "What's the bird?" 

"It's just a bird!" said Arthur impatiently. "It's like any other bird. It 
lays eggs and goes ark at things you can't see. Or kar or rit or 
something." 

"Have you seen one lay eggs?" said Ford, suspiciously. 



"For heaven's sake of course I have," said Arthur. "And I've eaten 
hundreds of them. Make rather a good omelette. The secret is little 
cubes of cold butter and then whipping it lightly with..." 

"I don't want a zarking recipe," said Ford. "I just want to be sure it's 
a real bird and not some kind of multi-dimensional cybernightmare." 

Fie slowly stood up from his crouched position and started to brush 
himself down. Fie was still watching the bird, though. 

"So," said Old Thrashbarg to Arthur. "Is it written that Bob shall 
once more take back unto himself the benediction of his once-given 
sandwich maker?" 

Ford almost went back into his crouch. 

"It's all right," muttered Arthur, "he always talks like that." Aloud, 
he said, "Ah, venerable Thrashbarg. Um, yes. I'm afraid I think I'm 
going to have to be popping off now. But young Drimple, my 
apprentice, will be a fine sandwich maker in my stead. Fie has the 
aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches, and the skills he has acquired so 
far, though rudimentary as yet, will, in time mature and, er, well, I 
think he'll work out OK is what I'm trying to say." 

Old Thrashbarg regarded him gravely. FHis old grey eyes moved 
sadly. Fie held his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing pikka bird, 
the other his staff. 

"O Sandwich Maker from Bob!" he pronounced. Fie paused, 
furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious 
contemplation. "Life," he said, "will be a very great deal less weird 
without you!" 

Arthur was stunned. 

"Do you know," he said, "I think that's the nicest thing anybody's 
ever said to me?" 

"Can we get on, please?" said Ford. 

Something was already happening. The presence of the pikka bird 
at the end of Thrashbarg's outstretched arm was sending tremors of 
interest through the thundering herd. The odd head flicked 
momentarily in their direction. Arthur began to remember some of 
the Perfectly Normal Beast hunts he had witnessed. Fie recalled that 
as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their capes there were 
always others standing behind them holding pikka birds. Fie had 
always assumed that, like him, they had just come along to watch. 



Old Thrashbarg moved forward, a little closer to the rolling herd. 
Some of the Beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at 
the sight of the pikka bird. 

Old Thrashbarg's outstretched arms were trembling. 

Only the pikka bird itself seemed to show no interest in what was 
going on. A few anonymous molecules of air nowhere in particular 
engaged all of its perky attention. 

"Now!" exclaimed Old Thrashbarg at last. "Now you may work 
them with the towel!" 

Arthur advanced with Ford's towel, moving the way the hunter- 
matadors did, with a kind of elegant strut that did not come at all 
naturally to him. But now he knew what to do and that it was right. 

He brandished and flicked the towel a few times, to be ready for the 
moment, and then he watched. 

Some distance away he spotted the Beast he wanted. Head down, 
it was galloping towards him, right on the very edge of the herd. Old 
Thrashbarg switched the bird, the Beast looked up, tossed its head, 
and then, just as its head was coming down again, Arthur flourished 
the towel in the Beast's line of sight. It tossed its head again in 
bemusement, and its eyes followed the movement of the towel. 

He had got the Beast's attention. 

From that moment on, it seemed the most natural thing to coax 
and draw the animal towards him. Its head was up, cocked slightly to 
one side. It was slowing to a canter and then a trot. A few seconds 
later the huge thing was standing there amongst them, snorting, 
panting, sweating, and sniffing excitedly at the pikka bird, which 
appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all. With strange sort of 
sweeping movements of his arms Old Thrashbarg kept the pikka bird 
in front of the Beast, but always out of its reach and always 
downwards. With strange sort of sweeping movements of the towel, 
Arthur kept drawing the Beast's attention this way and that - always 
downwards. 

"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life," 
muttered Ford to himself. 

At last, the Beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees. 

"Go!" whispered Old Thrashbarg urgently, to Ford. "Go! Go now!" 



Ford leapt up on to the great creature's back, scrabbling amongst 
its thick knotty fur for purchase, grasping great handfuls of the stuff 
to hold him steady once he was in position. 

"Now, Sandwich Maker! Go!" He performed some elaborate sign 
and ritual handshake which Arthur couldn't quite get the hang of 
because Old Thrashbarg had obviously made it up on the spur of the 
moment, then he pushed Arthur forward. Taking a deep breath, he 
clambered up behind Ford on to the great, hot, heaving back of the 
beast and held on tight. Huge muscles the size of sea lions rippled and 
flexed beneath him. 

Old Thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft. The Beast's head 
swivelled up to follow it. Thrashbarg pushed upwards and upwards 
repeatedly with his arms and with the pikka bird; and slowly, heavily 
the Perfectly Normal Beast lurched up off its knees and stood, at last, 
swaying slightly. Its two riders held on fiercely and nervously. 

Arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals, straining in an 
attempt to see where it was they were going, but there was nothing 
but heat haze. 

"Can you see anything?" he said to Ford. 

"No." Ford twisted round to glance back, trying to see if there was 
any clue as to where they had come from. Still, nothing. 

Arthur shouted down at Thrashbarg. 

"Do you know where they come from?" he called. "Or where 
they're going?" 

"The domain of the King!" shouted Old Thrashbarg back. 

"King?" shouted Arthur in surprise. "What King?" The Perfectly 
Normal Beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him. 

"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. "The 
King." 

"It's just that you never mentioned a King," shouted Arthur back, in 
some consternation. 

"What?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. The thrumming of a thousand 
hooves was very hard to hear over, and the old man was 
concentrating on what he was doing. 

Still holding the bird aloft, he led the Beast slowly round till it was 
once more parallel with the motion of its great herd. He moved 
forward. The Beast followed. He moved forward again. The Beast 



followed again. At last, the Beast was lumbering forward with a little 
momentum. 

"I said you never mentioned a King!" shouted Arthur again. 

"I didn't say a King," shouted Old Thrashbarg, "I said the King." 

He drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his 
strength, casting the pikka bird up into the air above the herd. This 
seemed to catch the pikka bird completely by surprise as it had 
obviously not been paying any attention at all to what was going on. It 
took it a moment or two to work out what was happening, then it 
unfurled its little wings, spread them out, and flew. 

"Go!" shouted Thrashbarg. "Go and meet your destiny, Sandwich 
Maker!" 

Arthur wasn't so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such. 

He just wanted to get to wherever it was they were going so he could 
get back off this creature again. He didn't feel at all safe up there. The 
Beast was gathering speed as it followed in the wake of the pikka bird. 
And then it was in at the fringes of the great tide of animals, and in a 
moment or two, with its head down, the pikka bird forgotten, it was 
running with the herd again and rapidly approaching the point at 
which the herd was vanishing into thin air. Arthur and Ford held on to 
the great monster for dear life, surrounded on all sides by hurtling 
mountains of bodies. 

"Go! Ride that Beast!" shouted Thrashbarg. His distant voice 
reverberated faintly in their ears. "Ride that Perfectly Normal Beast! 
Ride it, ride it!" 

Ford shouted in Arthur's ear, "Where did he say we were going?" 

"He said something about a King," shouted Arthur in return, 
holding on desperately. 

"What King?" 

"That's what I said. He just said the King." 

"I didn't know there was a the King," shouted Ford. 

"Nor did I," shouted Arthur back. 

"Except of course for the King," shouted Ford. "And I don't suppose 
he meant him." 


"What King?" shouted Arthur. 



The point of exit was almost upon them. Just ahead of them. 
Perfectly Normal Beasts were galloping into nothingness and 
vanishing. 

"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Ford. "I don't know what 
King. I'm only saying that he couldn't possibly mean the King, so I 
don't know what he means." 

"Ford, I don't know what you're talking about." 

"So?" said Ford. Then with a sudden rush, the stars came on, 
turned and twisted around their heads, and then, just as suddenly, 
turned off again. 



Chapter 21 


Misty grey buildings loomed and flickered. They bounced up and 
down in a highly embarrassing way. 

What sort of buildings were they? 

What were they for? What did they remind her of? 

It's so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when you 
suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has a 
different culture, a different set of the most basic assumptions about 
life, and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture. 

The sky above the buildings was a cold and hostile black. The stars, 
which should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from 
the sun were blurred and dulled by the thickness of the huge 
shielding bubble. Perspex or something like it. Something dull and 
heavy anyway. 

Tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning. 

She knew there was something slightly odd about it. 

Well, in fact, there were about a million things that were slightly 
odd about it, but there was one that was nagging at her and she 
hadn't quite got it. 

She sighed and yawned. 

As she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some of the 
dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing 
desk and tipped them into the bin. 

She was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production 
company in Soho. She had "DO NOT DISTURB" notices plastered all 
over the door, and a block on all incoming calls at the switch-board. 
This was originally to protect her astonishing scoop, but now it was to 
protect her from embarrassment. 

She would watch the tape all the way through again from the 
beginning. If she could bear to. She might do some fast forwarding 
here and there. 



It was about four o'clock on Monday afternoon, and she had a kind 
of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the cause of this 
slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage of candidates. 

First of all, it had all come on top of the overnight flight from New 
York. The red eye. Always a killer, that. 

Then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet 
Rupert. She was not sufficiently experienced in that sort of thing to be 
able to say for sure that that was always a killer, but she would be 
prepared to bet that those who went through it regularly cursed it. 
There were always stress charts being published in magazines. Fifty 
stress points for losing your job. Seventy-five points for a divorce or 
changing your hairstyle and so on. None of them ever mentioned 
being accosted on your lawn by aliens and then being flown to the 
planet Rupert, but she was sure it was worth a few dozen points. 

It wasn't that the journey had been particularly stressful. It had 
been extremely dull in fact. Certainly it had been no more stressful 
than the trip she had just taken across the Atlantic and it had taken 
roughly the same time, about seven hours. 

Well that was pretty astounding wasn't it? Flying to the outer limits 
of the solar system in the same time that it took to fly to New York 
meant they must have some fantastic unheard-of form of propulsion 
in the ship. She quizzed her hosts about it and they agreed that it was 
pretty good. 

"But how does it work?" she had demanded excitedly. She was still 
quite excited at the beginning of the trip. 

She found that part of the tape and played it through to herself. 

The Grebulons, which is what they called themselves, were politely 
showing her which buttons they pressed to make the ship go. 

"Yes, but what principle does it work on?" she heard herself 
demand, from behind the camera. 

"Oh, you mean is it something like a warp drive or something like 
that?" they said. 

"Yes," persisted Tricia. "What is it?" 

"It probably is something of the kind," they said. 

"Like what?" 

"Warp drive, photon drive, something like that. You'd have to ask 
the Flight Engineer." 



"Which one is he?" 

"We don't know. We have all lost our minds, you see." 

"Oh yes," said Tricia, a little faintly. "So you said. Um, how did you 
lose your minds, exactly, then?." 

"We don't know," they said, patiently. 

"Because you've lost your minds," echoed Tricia, glumly. 

"Would you like to watch television? It is a long flight. We watch 
television. It is something we enjoy." 

All of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine viewing it made. 
First of all the picture quality was extremely poor. Tricia didn't know 
why this was, exactly. She had a feeling that the Grebulons responded 
to a slightly different range of light frequencies, and that there had 
been a lot of ultra-violet around which was mucking up the video 
camera. There were a lot of interference patterns and video snow as 
well. Probably something to do with the warp drive that none of them 
knew the first thing about. 

So what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly thin 
and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions that were 
showing network broadcasts. She had also pointed the camera out of 
the very tiny viewport near her seat and got a nice, slightly streaky 
effect of stars. She knew it was real, but it would have taken a good 
three or four minutes to fake. 

In the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for 
Rupert itself and had simply sat back and watched television with 
them. She had even dozed off for a while. 

So part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all 
that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design, 
and had spent most of it dozing in front of reruns of M*A*S*H and 
Cagney and Lacey. But what else was there to do? She had taken 
some photos as well, of course, all of which had subsequently turned 
out to be badly fogged when she got them back from the chemist. 

Another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on 
Rupert. This at least had been dramatic and hair-raising. The ship had 
come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape, a terrain so 
desperately far removed from the heat and light of its parent sun that 
it seemed like a map of the psychological scars on the mind of an 
abandoned child. 



Lights blazed through the frozen darkness and Guided the ship into 
the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend itself open to 
accept the small craft. 

Unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and the 
depth at which the small thick viewport was set into the craft's skin, it 
hadn't been possible to get the video camera to point directly at any 
of it. She ran through that bit of the tape. 

The camera was pointing directly at the sun. 

This is normally very bad for a video camera. But when the sun is 
roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesn't do any harm. In fact it 
hardly makes any impression at all. You just get a small point of light 
right in the middle of the frame, which could be just about anything. 

It was just one star in a multitude. 

Tricia fast-forwarded. 

Ah. Now, the next bit had been quite promising. They had emerged 
out of the ship into a vast, grey, hangar-like structure. This was clearly 
alien technology on a dramatic scale. Huge grey buildings under the 
dark canopy of the Perspex bubble. These were the same buildings 
that she had been looking at the end of the tape. She had taken more 
footage of them while leaving Rupert a few hours later, just as she 
was about to reboard the spacecraft for the journey home. What did 
they remind her of? 

Well, as much as anything else they reminded her of a film set from 
just about any low-budget science-fiction movie of the last twenty 
years. A lot larger, of course, but it all looked thoroughly tawdry and 
unconvincing on the video screen. Apart from the dreadful picture 
quality she had been struggling with the unexpected effects of gravity 
that was appreciably lower than that on Earth, and she had found it 
very hard to keep the camera from bouncing around in an 
embarrassingly unprofessional way. It was therefore impossible to 
make out any detail. 

And now here was the Leader coming forward to greet her, smiling 
and sticking his hand out. 

That was all he was called. The Leader. 

None of the Grebulons had names, largely because they couldn't 
think of any. Tricia discovered that some of them had thought of 
calling themselves after characters from television programmes they 



had picked up from Earth, but hard as they had tried to call each 
other Wayne and Bobby and Chuck, some remnant of something 
lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had brought with them 
from the distant stars which were their homes must have told them 
that this really wasn't right and wouldn't do. 

The Leader had looked pretty much like all the others. Possibly a bit 
less thin. He said how much he enjoyed her shows on TV, that he was 
her greatest fan, how glad he was that she had been able to come 
along and visit them on Rupert and how much everybody had been 
looking forward to her coming, how he hoped the flight had been 
comfortable and so on. There was no particular sense she could 
detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or anything. 

Certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like some 
guy in costume and make-up, standing in front of a set that wouldn't 
hold up too well if you leant against it. 

She sat staring at the screen with her face cradled in her hands, 
and shaking her head in slow bewilderment. 

This was awful. 

Not only was this bit awful but she knew what was coming next. It 
was the bit where the Leader asked if she was hungry after the flight, 
and would she perhaps like to come and have something to eat? They 
could discuss things over a little dinner. 

She could remember what she was thinking at this point. 

Alien food. 

How was she going to deal with it? 

Would she actually have to eat it? Would she have access to some 
sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into? Wouldn't there be 
all sorts of differential immunity problems? 

It turned out to be hamburgers. 

Not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers it 
turned out to be were very clearly and obviously McDonald's 
hamburgers which had been reheated in a microwave. It wasn't just 
the look of them. It wasn't just the smell. It was the polystyrene 
clamshell packages they came in which had "McDonald's" printed all 
over them. 



"Eat! Enjoy!" said the Leader. "Nothing is too good for our 
honoured guest!" 

This was in his private apartment. Tricia had looked around it in 
bewilderment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless got it 
all on videotape. 

The apartment had a waterbed in it. And a Midi hi-fi. And one of 
those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table tops 
and appear to have large globules of sperm floating about in them. 
The walls were covered in velvet. 

The leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and 
squirted breath-freshener into his mouth. 

Tricia began to feel very scared, suddenly. She was further from 
Earth than any human being, to her knowledge, had ever been, and 
she was with an alien creature, who was lounging against a brown 
corduroy bean bag and squirting breath-freshener into his mouth. 

She didn't want to make any false moves. She didn't want to alarm 
him. But there were things she had to know. 

"How did you... where did you get... this?" she asked, gesturing 
around the room, nervously. 

"The decor?" asked the Leader. "Do you like it? It is very 
sophisticated. We are a sophisticated people, we Grebulons. We buy 
sophisticated consumer durables... by mail order." 

Tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point. 

"Mail order..." she had said. 

The Leader chuckled. It was one of those dark chocolate reassuring 
silky chuckles. 

"I think you think they ship it here. No! Ha Ha! We have arranged a 
special box number in New Hampshire. We make regular pick-up 
visits. Ha Ha!" He lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean bag, 
reached for a reheated french fry and nibbled the end of it, an 
amused smile playing across, his lips. 

Tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly. She 
kept the video camera going. 

"How do you, well, er, how do you pay for these 
wonderful...things?" 

The Leader chuckled again. 



"American Express," he said with a nonchalant shrug. 

Tricia nodded slowly again. She knew that they gave cards 
exclusively to just about anybody. 

"And these?" she said, holding up the hamburger he had presented 
her with. 

"It is very easy," said the Leader. "We stand in line." 

Again, Tricia realised with a cold, trickling feeling going down her 
spine, that explained an awful lot. 

She hit the fast forward button again. There was nothing of any use 
here at all. It was all nightmarish madness. She could have faked 
something that would have looked more convincing. 

Another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this 
hopeless awful tape, and she began, with slow horror, to realise that 
it must be the answer. 

She must be... 

She shook her head and tried to get a grip. 

An overnight flight going East... The sleeping pills she had taken to 
get her through it. The vodka she'd had to set the sleeping pills going. 

What else? Well. There was seventeen years of obsession that a 
glamorous man with two heads, one of which was disguised as a 
parrot in a cage, had tried to pick her up at a party but had then 
impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer. There 
suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to that idea 
that had never really occurred to her. Never occurred to her. In 
seventeen years. 

She stuffed her fist into her mouth. 

She must get help. 

Then there had been Eric Bartlett banging on about alien 
spacecraft landing on her lawn. And before that... New York had been, 
well, very hot and stressful. The high hopes and the bitter 
disappointment. The astrology stuff. 

She must have had a nervous breakdown. 

That was it. She was exhausted and she had had a nervous 
breakdown and had started hallucinating some time after she got 
home. She had dreamt the whole story. An alien race of people 



dispossessed of their own lives and histories, stuck on a remote 
outpost of our solar system and filling their cultural vacuum with our 
cultural junk. Ha! It was nature's way of telling her to check into an 
expensive medical establishment very quickly. 

She was very, very sick. She looked at how many large coffees 
she'd got through as well, and realised how heavily she was breathing 
and how fast. 

Part of solving any problem, she told herself, was realising that you 
had it. She started to bring her breathing under control. She had 
caught herself in time. She had seen where she was. She was on the 
way back from whatever psychological precipice she had been on the 
brink of. She started to calm down, to calm down, to calm down. She 
sat back in the chair and closed her eyes. 

After a while, now that she was breathing normally again, she 
opened them again. 

So where had she got this tape from then? 

* * * 

It was still running. 

All right. It was a fake. 

She had faked it herself, that was it. 

It must have been her who had faked it because her voice was all 
over the soundtrack, asking questions. Every now and then the 
camera would swing down at the end of a shot and she would see her 
own feet in her own shoes. She had faked it and she had no 
recollection of faking it or any idea of why she had done it. 

Her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy, 
flickering screen. 

She must still be hallucinating. 

She shook her head, trying to make it go away. She had no memory 
of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff. On the other hand she 
did seem to have memories that were very like the faked stuff. She 
continued to watch in a bewildered trance. 

The person she imagined to be called the Leader was questioning 
her about astrology and she was answering smoothly and calmly. Only 
she could detect the well-disguised rising panic in her own voice. 



The Leader pushed a button, and a maroon velvet wall slid aside, 
revealing a large bank of flat TV monitors. 

Each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different 
images: a few seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a cop 
show, a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security system, 
a few seconds from somebody's holiday movies, a few seconds of sex, 
a few seconds of news, a few seconds of comedy. It was clear that the 
Leader was very proud of all this stuff and he was waving his hands 
like a conductor while continuing at the same time to talk complete 
gibberish. 

Another wave of his hands, and all the screens cleared to form one 
giant computer screen showing in diagrammatic form all the planets 
of the solar system and mapped out against a background of the stars 
in their constellations. The display was completely static. 

"We have great skills," the Leader was saying. "Great skills in 
computation, in cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional 
navigational calculus. Great skills. Great, great skills. Only we have lost 
them. It is too bad. We like to have skills only they have gone. They 
are in space somewhere, hurtling. With our names and the details of 
our homes and loved ones. Please," he said, gesturing her forward to 
sit at the computer's console, "be skilful for us." 

Obviously what happened next was that Tricia quickly set the video 
camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene. She then walked 
into shot herself and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer 
display, spent a few moments familiarising herself with the interface 
and then started smoothly and competently to pretend that she had 
the faintest idea what she was doing. 

It hadn't been that difficult, in fact. 

She was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by training 
and a television presenter by experience, and what science she had 
forgotten over the years she was more than capable of making up by 
bluffing. 

The computer she was working on was clear evidence that the 
Grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture 
than their current vacuous state suggested, and with its aid she was 
able, within about half an hour, to cobble together a rough working 
model of the solar system. 



It wasn't particularly accurate or anything, but it looked good. The 
planets were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their 
orbits, and you could watch the movement of the whole piece of 
virtual cosmological clockwork from any point within the system - 
very roughly. You could watch from Earth, you could watch from Mars, 
etc. You could watch from the surface of the planet Rupert. Tricia had 
been quite impressed with herself, but also very impressed with the 
computer system she was working on. Using a computer workstation 
on Earth the task would probably have taken a year or so of 
programming. 

When she was finished, the Leader came up behind her and 
watched. He was very pleased and delighted with what she had 
achieved. 

"Good," he said. "And now, please, I would like you to demonstrate 
how to use the system you have just designed to translate the 
information in this book for me." 

Quietly he put a book down in front of her. 

It was You and Your Planets by Gail Andrews. 

Tricia stopped the tape again. 

She was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed. The feeling that she 
was hallucinating had now receded, but had not left anything any 
easier or clearer in her head. 

She pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered 
what to do. Years ago she had left the field of astronomical research 
because she knew, without any doubt whatsoever, that she had met a 
being from another planet. At a party. And she had also known, 
without any doubt whatsoever, that she would have made herself a 
laughing stock if she had ever said so. But how could she study 
cosmology and not say anything about the single most important 
thing she knew about it? She had done the only thing she could do. 

She had left. 

Now she worked in television and the same thing had happened 
again. 

She had videotape, actual videotape of the most astounding story 
in the history of, well anything: a forgotten outpost of an alien 



civilisation marooned on the outermost planet of our own solar 
system. 

She had the story. 

She had been there. 

She had seen it. 

She had the videotape for God's sake. 

And if she ever showed it to anybody, she would be a laughing 
stock. 

How could she prove any of this? It wasn't even worth thinking 
about. The whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle she 
cared to look at it from. Her head was beginning to throb. 

She had some aspirin in her bag. She went out of the little editing 
suite to the water dispenser down the corridor. She took the aspirin 
and drank several cups of water. 

The place seemed to be very quiet. Usually there were more 
people bustling about the place, or at least some people bustling 
around the place. She popped her head round the door of the editing 
suite next to hers but there was no one there. 

She had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her own 
suite. "DO NOT DISTURB," the notice read. "DO NOT EVEN THINK OF 
ENTERING. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. GO AWAY. I'M BUSY!" 

When she went back in she noticed that the message light on her 
phone extension was winking, and wondered how long it had been on. 

"Hello?" she said to the receptionist. 

"Oh, Miss McMillan, I'm so glad you called. Everybody's been trying 
to reach you. Your TV company. They're desperate to reach you. Can 
you call them?" 

"Why didn't you put them through?" said Tricia. 

"You said I wasn't to put anybody through for anything. You said I 
was to deny that you were even here. I didn't know what to do. I 
came up to give you a message, but..." 

"OK," said Tricia, cursing herself. She phoned her office. 

"Tricia! Where the haemorrhaging fuck are you?" 

"At the editing..." 

"They said..." 



"I know. What's up?" 

"What's up? Only a bloody alien spaceship!" 

"What? Where?" 

"Regent's Park. Big silver job. Some girl with a bird. She speaks 
English and throws rocks at people and wants someone to repair her 
watch. Just get there." 

Tricia stared at it. 

It wasn't a Grebulon ship. Not that she was suddenly an expert on 
extraterrestrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful silver and 
white thing about the size of a large ocean - going yacht, which is 
what it most resembled. Next to this, the structures of the huge half- 
dismantled Grebulon ship looked like gun turrets on a battleship. Gun 
turrets. That's what those blank grey buildings had looked like. And 
what was odd about them was that by the time she passed them 
again on her way to reboarding the small Grebulon craft, they had 
moved. These things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from 
the taxi to meet her camera crew. 

"Where's the girl?" she shouted above the noise of helicopters and 
police sirens. 

"There!" shouted the producer while the sound engineer hurried to 
clip a radio mike to her. "She says her mother and father came from 
here in some parallel dimension or something like that, and she's got 
her father's watch, and... I don't know. What can I tell you? Busk it. 
Ask her what it feels like to be from outer space." 

"Thanks a lot, Ted," muttered Tricia, checked that her mike was 
securely clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep breath, 
tossed her hair back and switched into her role of professional 
reporter, on home ground, ready for anything. 

At least, nearly anything. 

She turned to look for the girl. That must be her, with the wild hair 
and wild eyes. The girl turned towards her. And stared. 

"Mother!" she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at Tricia. 



Chapter 22 


Daylight exploded around them. Hot, heavy sun. A desert plain 
stretched out ahead in a haze of heat. They thundered out into it. 

"Jump!" shouted Ford Prefect. 

"What?" shouted Arthur Dent, holding on for dear life. 

There was no reply. 

"What did you say?" shouted Arthur again, and then realised that 
Ford Prefect was no longer there. He looked around in panic and 
started to slip. Realising he couldn't hold on any longer he pushed 
himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit 
the ground, rolling, rolling away from the pounding hooves. 

What a day, he thought, as he started furiously coughing dust up 
out of his lungs. He hadn't had a day as bad as this since the Earth had 
been blown up. He staggered up to his knees, and then up to his feet 
and started to run away. He didn't know what from or what to, but 
running away seemed a prudent move. 

He ran straight into Ford Prefect who was standing there surveying 
the scene. 

"Look," said Ford. "That is precisely what we need." 

Arthur coughed up some more dust, and wiped some other dust 
out of his hair and eyes. He turned, panting, to look at what Ford was 
looking at. 

It didn't look much like the domain of a King, or the King, or any 
kind of King. It looked quite inviting though. 

First, the context. This was a desert world. The dusty earth was 
packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of Arthur that 
hadn't already been bruised by the festivities of the previous night. 
Some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like sandstone, 
eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably fell in those parts 
into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched the fantastic shapes of 
the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the arid, orange 
landscape. 



For a moment Arthur dared to hope they had unexpectedly arrived 
in Arizona or New Mexico or maybe South Dakota, but there was 
plenty of evidence that this was not the case. 

The Perfectly Normal Beasts, for a start, still thundering, still 
pounding. They swept up in their tens of thousands from the far 
horizon, disappeared completely for about half a mile, then swept off, 
thundering and pounding to the distant horizon opposite. 

Then there were the spaceships parked in front of the Bar & Grill. 
Ah. The Domain of the King Bar & Grill. Bit of an anti-climax, thought 
Arthur to himself. 

In fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the 
Domain of the King Bar & Grill. The other three were in a parking lot 
by the side of the Bar and Grill. It was the one in front that caught the 
eye, though. Wonderful looking thing. Wild fins all over it, far, far too 
much chrome all over the fins and most of the actual bodywork 
painted in a shocking pink. It crouched there like an immense 
brooding insect and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump 
on something about a mile away. 

The Domain of the King Bar & Grill was slap bang in the middle of 
where the Perfectly Normal Beasts would be charging if they didn't 
take a minor transdimensional diversion on the way. It stood on its 
own, undisturbed. An ordinary Bar & Grill. A truckstop diner. 
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Quiet. The Domain of the King. 

"Gonna buy that spaceship," said Ford quietly. 

"Buy it?" said Arthur. "That's not like you. I thought you usually 
pinched them." 

"Sometimes you have to show a little respect," said Ford. 

"Probably have to show a little cash as well," said Arthur. "Flow the 
hell much is that thing worth?" 

With a tiny movement. Ford brought his Dine-O-Charge credit card 
up out of his pocket. Arthur noticed that the hand holding it was 
trembling very slightly. 

"I'll teach them to make me the restaurant critic..." breathed Ford. 

"What do you mean?" asked Arthur. 

"I'll show you," said Ford with a nasty glint in his eye. 

"Let's go and run up a few expenses shall we?" 



"Couple beers," said Ford, "and, I dunno, a couple bacon rolls, 
whatever you got, oh and that pink thing outside." 

He flipped his card on the top of the bar and looked around 
casually. 

There was a kind of silence. 

There hadn't been a lot of noise before, but there was definitely a 
kind of silence now. Even the distant thunder of the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts carefully avoiding the Domain of the King seemed suddenly a 
little muted. 

"Just rode into town," said Ford as if nothing was odd about that or 
about anything else. He was leaning against the bar at an 
extravagantly relaxed angle. 

There were about three other customers in the place, sitting at 
tables, nursing beers. About three. Some people would say there 
were exactly three, but it wasn't that kind of a place, not the kind of a 
place that you felt like being that specific in. There was some big guy 
setting up some stuff on the little stage as well. Old drum kit. Couple 
guitars. Country and Western kind of stuff. 

The barman was not moving very swiftly to get in Ford's order. In 
fact he wasn't moving at all. 

"Not sure that the pink thing's for sale," he said at last in the kind 
of accent that went on for quite a long time. 

"Sure it is," said Ford. "How much you want?" 

"Well..." 

"Think of a number. I'll double it." 

"T'ain't mine to sell," said the barman. 

"So, whose?" 

The barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage. Big fat 
guy, moving slow, balding. 

Ford nodded. He grinned. 

"OK," he said. "Get the beers, get the rolls. Keep the tab open." 

Arthur sat at the bar and rested. He was used to not knowing what 
was going on. He felt comfortable with it. The beer was pretty good 
and made him a little sleepy which he didn't mind at all. The bacon 
rolls were not bacon rolls. They were Perfectly Normal Beast rolls. He 



exchanged a few professional roll-making remarks with the barman 
and just let Ford get on with whatever Ford wanted to do. 

"OK," said Ford, returning to his stool. "It's cool. We got the pink 
thing." 

The barman was very surprised. "Fle's selling it to you?" 

"Fle's giving it to us for free," said Ford, taking a gnaw at his roll. 
"Fley, no, keep the tab open though. We have some items to add to it. 
Good roll." 

He took a deep pull of beer. 

"Good beer," he added. "Good ship too," he said, eying the big pink 
and chrome insect-like thing, bits of which could be seen through the 
windows of the bar. "Good everything, pretty much. You know, he 
said, sitting back, reflectively, "it's at times like this that you kind of 
wonder if it's worth worrying about the fabric of space/time and the 
causal integrity of the multi-dimensional probability matrix and the 
potential collapse of all wave forms in the Whole Sort of General Mish 
Mash and all that sort of stuff that's been bugging me. Maybe I feel 
that what the big guy says is right. Just let it all go. What does it 
matter? Let it go." 

"Which big guy?" said Arthur. 

Ford just nodded towards the stage. The big guy was saying "one 
two" into the mike a couple of times. Couple other guys were on the 
stage now. Drums. Guitar. 

The barman, who had been silent for a moment or two, said, "You 
say he's letting you have his ship?" 

"Yeah," said Ford. "Let it all go is what he said. Take the ship. Take 
it with my blessing. Be good to her. I will he good to her." 

He took a pull at his beer again. 

"Like I was saying," he went on. "It's at times like this that you kind 
of think, let it all go. But then you think of guys like InfiniDim 
Enterprises and you think, they are not going to get away with it. They 
are going to suffer. It is my sacred and holy duty to see those guys 
suffer. Here, let me put something on the tab for the singer. I asked 
for a special request and we agreed. It's to go on the tab. OK?" 

"OK," said the barman, cautiously. Then he shrugged. "OK, 
however you want to do it. How much?" 



Ford named a figure. The barman fell over amongst the bottles and 
glasses. Ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all 
right and help him back up to his feet. He'd cut his finger and his 
elbow a bit and was feeling a little woozy but was otherwise fine. The 
big guy started to sing. The barman hobbled off with Ford's credit 
card to get authorisation. 

"Is there stuff going on here that I don't know about?" said Arthur 
to Ford. 

"Isn't there usually?" said Ford. 

"No need to be like that," said Arthur. Fie began to wake up. 
"Shouldn't we be going?" he said suddenly. "Will that ship get us to 
Earth?" 

"Sure will," said Ford. 

"That's where Random will be going!" said Arthur with a start. "We 
can follow her! But... er..." 

Ford let Arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he 
got out his old edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

"But where are we on the probability axis thing?" said Arthur. "Will 
the Earth be there or not there? I spent so much time looking for it. 

All I found was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it, though 
it was clearly the right place because of the continents. The worst 
version was called NowWhat where I got bitten by some wretched 
little animal. That's how they communicated, you know, by biting 
each other. Bloody painful. Then half the time, of course, the Earth 
isn't even there because it's been blown up by the bloody Vogons. 
Flow much sense am I making?" 

Ford didn't comment. Fie was listening to something. Fie passed 
the Guide over to Arthur and pointed at the screen. The active entry 
read "Earth. Mostly harmless." 

"You mean it's there!" said Arthur excitedly. "The Earth is there! 
That's where Random will be going! The bird was showing her the 
Earth in the rainstorm!" 

Ford motioned Arthur to shout a little less loudly. Fie was listening. 

Arthur was growing impatient. He'd heard bar singers sing "Love 
Me Tender" before. Fie was a bit surprised to hear it here, right in the 
middle of wherever the hell this was, certainly not Earth, but then 
things tended not to surprise him these days as much as formerly. The 



singer was quite good, as bar singers went, if you liked that sort of 
thing, but Arthur was getting fretful. 

He glanced at his watch. This only served to remind him that he 
didn't have his watch any more. Random had it, or at least the 
remains of it. 

"Don't you think we should be going?" he said, insistently. 

"Shhh!" said Ford. "I paid to hear this song." He seemed to have 
tears in his eyes, which Arthur found a bit disturbing. He'd never seen 
Ford moved by anything other than very, very strong drink. Probably 
the dust. He waited, tapping his fingers irritably, out of time with the 
music. 

The song ended. The singer went on to do "Heartbreak Hotel". 

"Anyway," Ford whispered, "I've got to review the restaurant." 

"What?" 

"I have to write a review." 

"Write a review? Of this place?" 

"Filing the review validates the expenses claim. I've fixed it so that 
it happens completely automatically and untraceably. This bill is going 
to need some validation," he added quietly, staring into his beer with 
a nasty smirk. 

"For a couple of beers and a roll?" 

"And a tip for the singer." 

"Why, how much did you tip him?" 

Ford named a figure again. 

"I don't know how much that is," said Arthur. "What's it worth in 
pounds sterling? What would it buy you?" 

"It would probably buy you, roughly... er..." Ford screwed his eyes 
up as he did some calculations in his head. "Switzerland," he said at 
last. He picked up his Hitchhiker's Guide and started to type. 

Arthur nodded intelligently. There were times when he wished he 
understood what on earth Ford was talking about, and other times, 
like now, when he felt it was probably safer not even to try. He looked 
over Ford's shoulder. "This isn't going to take long, is it?" he said. 

"Nah," said Ford. "Piece of piss. Just mention that the rolls were 
quite good, the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely eccentric, the 



bar singer the best in the known universe, and that's about it. Doesn't 
need much. Just a validation." 

He touched an area on the screen marked ENTER and the message 
vanished into the Sub-Etha. 

"You thought the singer was pretty good then?" 

"Yeah," said Ford. The barman was returning with a piece of paper, 
which seemed to be trembling in his hand. 

He pushed it over to Ford with a kind of nervous, reverential twitch. 

"Funny thing," said the barman. "The system rejected it first couple 
times. Can't say it surprised me." Beads of sweat were standing on his 
brow. "Then suddenly it's, oh yeah, that's OK, and the system... er, 
validates it. Just like that. You wanna...sign it?" 

Ford scanned the form quickly. He sucked his teeth. "This is going 
to hurt InfiniDim a lot," he said, with an appearance of concern. "Oh 
well," he added softly, "screw 'em." 

He signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman. 

"More money," he said, "than the Colonel made for him in an 
entire career of doing crap movies and casino gigs. Just for doing what 
he does best. Standing up and singing in a bar. And he negotiated it 
himself. I think this is a good moment for him. Tell him I said thanks 
and buy him a drink." He tossed a few coins on the bar. The barman 
pushed them away. 

"I don't think that's necessary," he said, slightly hoarsely. 

"Tis to me," said Ford. "OK, we are outa here." 

They stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big pink 
and chrome thing with amazement and admiration. Or at least. Ford 
looked at it with amazement and admiration. 

Arthur just looked at it. "You don't think it's a bit overdone, do 
you?" 

He said it again when they climbed inside it. The seats and quite a 
lot of the controls were covered in fine fur skin or suede. There was a 
big gold monogram on the main control panel which just read "EP". 

"You know," said Ford as he fired up the ship's engines, "I asked 
him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens, and you know 
what he said?" 



"Who?" said Arthur. 

"The King." 

"Which King? Oh, we've had this conversation, haven't we?" 

"Never mind," said Ford. "For what it's worth, he said, no. Fie went 
of his own accord." 

"I'm still not sure who we're talking about," said Arthur. Ford shook 
his head. "Look," he said, "there are some tapes over in the 
compartment to your left. Why don't you choose some music and put 
it on?" 

"OK," said Arthur, and flipped through the cartons. "Do you like 
Elvis Presley?" he said. 

"Yeah I do as a matter of fact," said Ford. "Now. I hope this 
machine can leap like it looks like it can." Fie engaged the main drive. 

"Yeeehaah!" shouted Ford as they shot upwards at face-tearing 
speed. 

It could. 



Chapter 23 


The news networks don't like this kind of thing. They regard it as a 
waste. An incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere in the 
middle of London and it is sensational news of the highest magnitude. 
Another completely different one arrives three and a half hours later 
and somehow it isn't. 

"ANOTHER SPACECRAFT!" said the headlines and news stand 
billboards. "THIS ONE'S PINK." A couple of months later they could 
have made a lot more of it. The third spacecraft, half an hour after 
that, the little four berth Hrundi runabout, only made it on to the 
local news. 

Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere 
and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after six-thirty in the 
evening and there were spaces free. They mingled briefly with the 
crowd that gathered round to ogle, then said loudly that if no one else 
was going to call the police they would, and made good their escape. 

"Home..." said Arthur, a husky tone creeping into his voice as he 
gazed, misty-eyed around him. 

"Oh don't get all maudlin on me," snapped Ford. "We have to find 
your daughter and we have to find that bird thing." 

"How?" said Arthur. "This is a planet of five and a half billion 
people, and..." 

"Yes," said Ford. "But only one of them has just arrived from outer 
space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a mechanical bird. I 
suggest we just find a television and something to drink while we 
watch it. We need some serious room service." They checked into a 
large two-bedroomed suite at the Langham. Mysteriously, Ford's 
Dine-O-Charge card, issued on a planet over five thousand light years 
away, seemed to present the hotel's computer with no problems. 

Ford hit the phones straight away while Arthur attempted to locate 
the television. 



"OK," said Ford. "I want to order up some margaritas please. 

Couple of pitchers. Couple of Chefs Salads. And as much foie gras as 
you've got. And also London Zoo." 

"She's on the news!" shouted Arthur from the next room. 

"That's what I said," said Ford into the phone. "London Zoo. Just 
charge it to the room." 

"She's... Good God!" shouted Arthur. "Do you know who she's 
being interviewed by?" 

"Are you having difficulty understanding the English language?" 
continued Ford. "It's the zoo just up the road from here. I don't care if 
it's closed this evening. I don't want to buy a ticket, I just want to buy 
the zoo. I don't care if you're busy. This is room service, I'm in a room 
and I want some service. Got a piece of paper? OK. Flere's what I want 
you to do. All the animals that can be safely returned to the wild, 
return them. Set up some good teams of people to monitor their 
progress in the wild, see that they're doing OK." 

"It's Trillian!" shouted Arthur. "Or is it... er... God, I can't stand all 
this parallel universe stuff. It's so bloody confusing. It seems to be a 
different Trillian. It's Tricia McMillan which is what Trillian used to be 
called before... er... Why don't you come and watch, see if you can 
figure it out?" 

"Just a second," Ford shouted, and returned to his negotiations 
with room service. "Then we'll need some natural reserves for the 
animals that can't hack it in the wild," he said. "Set up a team to work 
out the best places to do that. We might need to buy somewhere like 
Zaire and maybe some islands. Madagascar. Baffin. Sumatra. Those 
kind of places. We'll need a wide variety of habitats. Look, I don't see 
why you're seeing this as a problem. Learn to delegate. Hire whoever 
you want. Get on to it. I think you'll find my credit is good. And blue 
cheese dressing on the salad. Thank you." 

He put the phone down and went through to Arthur, who was 
sitting on the edge of his bed watching television. 

"I ordered us some foie gras," said Ford. 

"What?" said Arthur, whose attention was entirely focused on the 
television. 

"I said I ordered us some foie gras." 



"Oh," said Arthur, vaguely. "Um, I always feel a hit bad about foie 
gras. Bit cruel to the geese, isn't it?" 

"Fuck 'em," said Ford, slumping on the bed. "You can't care about 
every damn thing." 

"Well, that's all very well for you to say, but..." 

"Drop it!" said Ford. "If you don't like it I'll have yours. What's 
happening?" 

"Chaos!" said Arthur. "Complete chaos! Random keeps on 
screaming at Trillian, or Tricia or whoever it is, that she abandoned 
her and then demanding to go to a good night club. Tricia's broken 
down in tears and says she's never even met Random let alone given 
birth to her. Then she suddenly started howling about someone called 
Rupert and said that he had lost his mind or something. I didn't quite 
follow that bit, to be honest. Then Random started throwing stuff and 
they've cut to a commercial break while they try and sort it all out. Oh 
They've just cut back to the studio! Shut up and watch." 

A rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and 
apologised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item. Fie said 
he didn't have any very clear news to report, only that the mysterious 
girl, who called herself Random Frequent Flyer Dent had left the 
studio to, er, rest. Tricia McMillan would be, he hoped, back 
tomorrow. Meanwhile, fresh reports of UFO activity were coming in... 

Ford leaped up off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed 
at a number. 

"Concierge? You want to own the hotel? It's yours if you can find 
out for me in five minutes which clubs Tricia McMillan belongs to. Just 
charge the whole thing to this room." 



Chapter 24 


Away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were being 
made. 

Invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and 
temperamental Plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely 
multitudinous possibilities of the planet called Earth, but not 
inconsequential to them. 

At the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a green 
leatherette sofa, staring fretfully at a range of TV and computer 
screens sat a very worried Grebulon leader. He was fiddling with stuff. 
Fiddling with his book on astrology. Fiddling with the console of his 
computer. Fiddling with the displays being fed through to him 
constantly from all of the Grebulons monitoring devices, all of them 
focused on the planet Earth. 

He was distressed. Their mission was to monitor. But to monitor 
secretly. He was a bit fed up with his mission, to be honest. He was 
fairly certain that his mission must have been to do more than sit 
around watching TV for years on end. They certainly had a lot of other 
equipment with them that must have had some purpose if only they 
hadn't accidentally lost all trace of their purpose. He needed a sense 
of purpose in life, which was why he had turned to astrology to fill the 
yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and soul. That 
would tell him something, surely. 

Well, it was telling him something. 

It was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he was about to 
have a very bad month, that things were going to go from bad to 
worse if he didn't get a grip on things and start making some positive 
moves and thinking things out for himself. 

It was true. It was very clear from his star chart which he had 
worked out using his astrology book and the computer program 
which that nice Tricia McMillan had designed for him to re-triangulate 
all the appropriate astronomical data. Earth-based astrology had to 



be entirely recalculated to yield results that were meaningful to the 
Grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges of the 
solar system. 

The recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unambiguously 
that he was going to have a very bad month indeed, starting with 
today. Because today Earth was starting to rise into Capricorn, and 
that, for the Grebulon leader, who showed all the character signs of 
being a classic Taurus, was very bad indeed. 

Now was the time, his horoscope said, for taking positive actions, 
making tough decisions, seeing what needed to be done and doing it. 
This was all very difficult for him, but he knew that nobody ever said 
that doing tough stuff wasn't tough. The computer was already 
tracking and predicting the second-by-second location of the planet 
Earth. He ordered the great grey turrets to swivel. 

Because all of the Grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on 
the planet Earth, it failed to spot that there was now another source 
of data in the solar system. 

Its chances of spotting this other source of data - a massive yellow 
constructor ship - accidentally were practically nil. It was as far from 
the sun as Rupert was, but almost diametrically opposite, almost 
hidden by the sun. 

Almost. 

The massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor 
events on Planet Ten without being spotted itself. It had managed this 
very successfully. 

There were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was 
diametrically opposite to the Grebulons. 

Its leader, its Captain, had a very clear idea of what his purpose was. 
It was a very simple and plain one and he had been pursuing it in his 
simple, plain way for a considerable period of time now. 

Anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a 
pointless and ugly one, that it wasn't the sort of purpose that 
enhanced a life, put a spring in a person's step, made birds sing and 
flowers bloom. Rather the reverse in fact. Absolutely the reverse. 

It wasn't his job to worry about that, though. It was his job to do 
his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain narrowness of 



vision and circularity of thought then it wasn't his job to worry about 
such things. Any such things that came his way were referred to 
others who had, in turn, other people to refer such things to. 

Many, many light years from here, indeed from anywhere, lies the 
grim and long abandoned planet, Vogsphere. Somewhere on a fetid, 
fog-bound mud bank on this planet there stands, surrounded by the 
dirty, broken and empty carapaces of the last few jeweled scuttling 
crabs, a small stone monument which marks the place, where it is 
thought, the species Vogon Vogonblurtus first arose. On the 
monument there is carved an arrow which points away into the fog, 
under which are inscribed in plain, simple letters the words "The buck 
stops there." 

Deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship, the Vogon Captain 
grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared piece of 
paper that lay in front of him. A demolition order. 

If you were to unravel exactly where the Captain's job, which was 
to do his job which was to do his job, actually began, then it all came 
down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued to him by his 
immediate superior long ago. The piece of paper had an instruction 
on it, and his purpose was to carry out that instruction and put a little 
tick mark in the adjacent box when he had carried it out. 

He had carried out the instruction once before, but a number of 
troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able to put 
the tick in the little box. 

One of the troublesome circumstances was the Plural nature of this 
Galactic sector, where the possible continually interfered with the 
probable. Simple demolition didn't get you any further than pushing 
down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper. Anything you 
demolished kept on popping up again. That would soon be taken care 
of. 

Another was a small bunch of people who continually refused to be 
where they were supposed to be when they were supposed to be 
there. That, also, would soon be taken care of. 

The third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That was now well and truly taken 
care of and, in fact, through the phenomenal power of temporal 
reverse engineering, it was now itself the agency through which 
everything else would be taken care of. The Captain had merely come 



to watch the final act of this drama. He himself did not have to lift a 
finger. 

"Show me," he said. 

The shadowy shape of a bird spread its wings and rose into the air 
near him. Darkness engulfed the bridge. Dim lights danced briefly in 
the black eyes of the bird as, deep in its instructional address space, 
bracket after bracket was finally closing, if clauses were finally ending, 
repeat loops halting, recursive functions calling themselves for the 
last few times. 

A brilliant vision lit up in the darkness, a watery blue and green 
vision, a tube flowing through the air, shaped like a chopped up string 
of sausages. 

With a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the Vogon Captain sat back to 
watch. 



Chapter 25 


"Just there, number forty-two," shouted Ford Prefect to the taxi- 
driver. "Right here!" 

The taxi lurched to a halt, and Ford and Arthur jumped out. They 
had stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the way, and 
Ford chucked a fistful of money through the window at the driver. 

The entrance to the club was dark, smart and severe. Only the 
smallest little plaque bore its name. Members knew where it was, and 
if you weren't a member then knowing where it was wasn't any help 
to you. 

Ford Prefect was not a member of Stavro's though he had once 
been to Stavro's other club in New York. Fie had a very simple method 
of dealing with establishments of which he was not a member. Fie 
simply swept in as soon as the door was opened, pointed back at 
Arthur and said, "It's OK, he's with me." 

Fie bounded down the dark glossy stairs, feeling very froody in his 
new shoes. They were suede and they were blue, and he was very 
pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had been sharp- 
eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the back of a 
speeding taxi. 

"I thought I told you not to come here." 

"What?" said Ford. 

A thin, ill-looking man wearing something baggy and Italian was 
walking up the stairs past them, lighting a cigarette, and had stopped, 
suddenly. 

"Not you," he said. "Him." 

He looked straight at Arthur, then seemed to become a little 
confused. 

"Excuse me," he said. "I think I must have mistaken you for 
someone else." He started on up the stairs again, but almost 
immediately turned round once more, even more puzzled. He stared 
at Arthur. 



"Now what?" said Ford. 

"What did you say?" 

"I said, now what?" repeated Ford irritably. 

"Yes, I think so," said the man and swayed slightly and dropped the 
book of matches he'd been carrying. His mouth moved weakly. Then 
he put his hand to his forehead. 

"Excuse me," he said, "I'm trying desperately to remember which 
drug I've just taken, but it must be one of those ones which mean you 
can't remember." 

Fie shook his head and turned away again, and went up towards 
the men's room. 

"Come on," said Ford. Fie hurried on downstairs, with Arthur 
following nervously in his wake. The encounter had shaken him badly 
and he didn't know why. 

Fie didn't like places like this. For all of the dreams of Earth and 
home he had had for years, he now badly missed his hut on Lamuella 
with his knives and his sandwiches. Fie even missed Old Thrashbarg. 

"Arthur!" 

It was the most astounding effect. His name was being shouted in 
stereo. 

He twisted to look one way. Up the stairs behind him he saw 
Trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled 
RymplonTM. She was looking suddenly aghast. 

He twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly 
aghast at. 

At the bottom of the stairs was Trillian, wearing... No - this was 
Tricia. Tricia that he had just seen, hysterical with confusion, on 
television. And behind her was Random, looking more wild-eyed than 
ever. Behind her in the recesses of the smart, dimly lit club, the other 
clientele of the evening formed a frozen tableau, staring anxiously up 
at the confrontation on the stairs. 

For a few seconds everyone stood stock still. Only the music from 
behind the bar didn't know to stop throbbing. 

"The gun she is holding," said Ford quietly, nodding slightly towards 
Random, "is a Wabanatta 3. It was in the ship she stole from me. It's 
quite dangerous in fact. Just don't move for a moment. Let's just 
everybody stay calm and find out what's upsetting her." 



"Where do I fit?" screamed Random suddenly. The hand holding 
the gun was trembling fiercely. Her other hand delved into her pocket 
and pulled out the remains of Arthur's watch. She shook it at them. 

"I thought I would fit here," she cried, "on the world that made me! 
But it turns out that even my mother doesn't know who I am!" She 
flung the watch violently aside, and it smashed into the glasses 
behind the bar, scattering its innards. 

Everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer. 

"Random," said Trillian quietly from up on the stairs. 

"Shut up!" shouted Random. "You abandoned me!" 

"Random, it is very important that you listen to me and 
understand," persisted Trillian quietly. "There isn't very much time. 

We must leave. We must all leave." 

"What are you talking about? We're always leaving!" She had both 
hands on the gun now, and both were shaking. There was no one in 
particular she was pointing it at. She was just pointing it at the world 
in general. 

"Listen," said Trillian again. "I left you because I went to cover a 
war for the network. It was extremely dangerous. At least, I thought it 
was going to be. I arrived and the war had suddenly ceased to happen. 
There was a time anomaly and... listen! Please listen! A 
reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up, the rest of the fleet 
was scattered in some farcical disarray. It's happening all the time 
now." 

"I don't care! I don't want to hear about your bloody job!" shouted 
Random. "I want a home! I want to fit somewhere!" 

"This is not your home," said Trillian, still keeping her voice calm. 
"You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly anybody has 
one any more. The missing ship I was just talking about. The people of 
that ship don't have a home. They don't know where they are from. 
They don't even have any memory of who they are or what they are 
for. They are very lost and very confused and very frightened. They 
are here in this solar system, and they are about to do something 
very... misGuided because they are so lost and confused. We... must... 
leave... now. I can't tell you where there is to go to. Perhaps there 
isn't anywhere. But here is not the place to be. Please. One more time. 
Can we go?" 



Random was wavering in panic and confusion. 

"It's all right," said Arthur gently. "If I'm here, we're safe. Don't ask 
me to explain just now, but I am safe, so you are safe. OK?" 

"What are you saying?" said Trillian. 

"Let's all just relax," said Arthur. He was feeling very tranquil. His 
life was charmed and none of this seemed real. 

Slowly, gradually, Random began to relax, and to let the gun down, 
inch by inch. 

Two things happened simultaneously. 

The door to the men's room at the top of the stairs opened, and 
the man who had accosted Arthur came out, sniffing. 

Startled at the sudden movement, Random lifted the gun again just 
as a man standing behind her made a grab for it. 

Arthur threw himself forward. There was a deafening explosion. He 
fell awkwardly as Trillian threw herself down over him. The noise died 
away. Arthur looked up to see the man at the top of the stairs gazing 
down at him with a look of utter stupefaction. 

"You..." he said. Then slowly, horribly, he fell apart. 

Random threw the gun down and fell to her knees, sobbing. "I'm 
sorry!" she said. "I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry..." 

Tricia went to her. Trillian went to her. 

Arthur sat on the stairs with his head between his hands and had 
not the faintest idea what to do. Ford was sitting on the stair beneath 
him. He picked something up, looked at it with interest, and passed it 
up to Arthur. 

"This mean anything to you? he said. 

Arthur took it. It was the book of matches which the dead man had 
dropped. It had the name of the club on it. It had the name of the 
proprietor of the club on it. It looked like this: 

STAVRO MUELLER 

BETA 


He stared at it for some time as things began slowly to reassemble 
themselves in his mind. He wondered what he should do, but he only 
wondered it idly. Around him people were beginning to rush and 
shout a lot, but it was suddenly very clear to him that there was 



nothing to be done, not now or ever. Through the new strangeness of 
noise and light he could just make out the shape of Ford Prefect 
sitting back and laughing wildly. 

A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew that at last, 
for once and for ever, it was now all, finally, over. 

In the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the Vogon ship, 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz sat alone. Lights flared briefly across the 
external vision screens that lined one wall. In the air above him the 
discontinuities in the blue and green watery sausage shape resolved 
themselves. Options collapsed, possibilities folded into each other, 
and the whole at last resolved itself out of existence. 

A very deep darkness descended. The Vogon captain sat immersed 
in it for a few seconds. 

"Light" he said. 

There was no response. The bird, too, had crumpled out of all 
possibility. 

The Vogon turned on the light himself. He picked up the piece of 
paper again and placed a little tick in the little box. 

Well, that was done. His ship slunk off into the inky void. 

In spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely positive 
piece of action, the Grebulon Leader ended up having a very bad 
month after all. It was pretty much the same as all the previous 
months except that there was now nothing on the television any 
more. He put on a little light music instead.

1 President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. 

The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The 
hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. 
In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field 
which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs 
are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political 
upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two 
down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used 
to act simply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental 
assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it 
vests in no such place. 

The President in particular is very much a figurehead - he wields no 
real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, 
but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership 
but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is 
always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating 
character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away 
from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most 
successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent 
two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few 
people realize that the President and the Government have virtually 



no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence 
ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly 
believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a 
computer. They couldn't be more wrong. 

2 Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure 
Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing 
Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old 
Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford's father was the 
only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing FI rung 
disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able 
satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep 
mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Flrung was nor why it had 
chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford's father, 
magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had 
inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where 
he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he 
christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue. 

Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father 
eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some 
parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him lx, which 
in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as "boy who is not able 
satisfactorily to explain what a Flrung is, nor why it should choose to 
collapse on Betelgeuse Seven".
